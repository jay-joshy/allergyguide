    <!-- 1. The user is presented with 3 input bars in-line. The first input bar is a search bar with drop-down results -- as they type they get a fuzzy find search through possible allergens (see .js file for list). If they type in something that doesn't exist, they should also have the option of creating a custom allergen entry. This input bar should be focused (ie. autofocus) -->
    <!-- 2. They should be able to TAB to the next input bar, which allows them to input the mm diameter of the test. -->
    <!-- 3. The last input bar is for an optional note for the entry. -->
    <!-- 4. Once they press CTRL-ENTER, the entry is "added", and a new 'fresh' set of 3 input bars pushes the entry below. The old entry will be displayed both as an editable section below the 'fresh' input and also in the display below.
So, after adding an entry, the inputs reset, and the added entry is shown in an editable section (maybe as a row with the three fields and an X button), and also in the code blocks.

     -->
    <!-- 5. Each entry once entered should have an X to the very right that allows it to be quickly deleted. -->

  <!-- Beneath the entry creation section, is the display section which shows the plaintext tables in code blocks for easy copy and pasting. One section is for a simple list of entries, the other is for the table with two columns format. -->
