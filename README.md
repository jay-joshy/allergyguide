## Goals

A resident-led and faculty-reviewed website for high-yield and concise information about 1) conditions 2) therapies/medications 3) patient resources. It is meant for **practical use by residents/fellows, or other non-allergist physicians looking to learn**.

While there are other medical education sites available (for example, [the practical guide to allergy/immunology 2024](https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/supplements/volume-20-supplement-3)), we will provide more focused, practical, and less-text-dense articles on conditions, in addition to a much wider scope of content.

Please refer to the [about](allergyguide.ca/about/) section of the website for more specific breakdown of the goals and planned content.

## What is required to make this succeed both short and long term?

- A consistent editor
- A well-defined contributing process, with a way for non-coders to contribute
- Well defined topics
- Resident contribution across Canada
- Faculty support (as reviewers, maybe as sponsors?) across Canada

For further details re: contributing process, formatting, content for topics/macros/etc., **please see the [contribution page](https://allergyguide.ca/contribute/)**

## Nitty gritty about site function:

Site is deployed from Netlify from GitHub. It is built using Zola, an excellent open-source static site generator with the Abridge theme as a base (with some custom JavaScript, HTML, and SCSS along the way). It uses Tera templating for the webpages. It is all open-source.
