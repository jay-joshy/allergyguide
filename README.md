## Goals

A resident-led and faculty-reviewed website for high-yield and concise information about 1) conditions 2) therapies/medications 3) patient resources. It is meant for **practical use by residents/fellows, or other non-allergist physicians looking to learn**.

Secondary goals if time permits includes:

- Sets of questions for RC studying
- Case reviews of high-yield clinical scenarios
- Deep-dives in separate subpages for more fellow-focused content for each topic
- Critical appraisal of landmark / new research
- Patient resources translated into different languages -- also with specific geographics (ie. BC, ON, etc.)

## What is required to make this succeed both short and long term?

- A consistent editor (hopefully Josh)
- A well-defined contributing process (and a way for non-coders to contribute)
- Well defined topics to address / have goals towards
- Resident contribution across Canada
- Faculty support (as reviewers, maybe as sponsors?)

For further details re: contributing process, formatting, content for topics/macros/etc., **please see the [contribution page](https://allergyguide.ca/contribute/)**

- Homepage
- Conditions/Topics -- patient resources are included for each
- Meds -- categorized medication cards for easy reference
- Clinical tools
