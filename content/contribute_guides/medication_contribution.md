- Medications can be found in this [page here](/medications/) and are also accessible through popups {% popup() %}

{{ medications_toml_load(meds=["bilastine"])}}

{% end %}

- The goal is to provide cards that are succinct and relevant, not a deep dive – the user can look at the monograph if needed for more detail
- As such, there's a relatively standardized structure/format for medications
  - The editors will deal with the categories section
  - Monographs will be statically hosted and linked. Include a link for the monograph in your draft file so it can be uploaded to the site (**it should come from a government site**!!)

```toml
# All sections accept HTML aside from the pearls, which accepts markdown format
[template_med]
# [medname] must be formatted as {generic (hyphenate if combination)} with {_route} if dramatically different from oral.
# for example: [budesonide_inhaler] because the oral form is used for EoE.
# similarly, [fluticasone-furoate_inhaler] - note the hyphenation used between the drug combos.

Here is an example:

```toml
[bilastine]
draft = false
categories = ["2G antihistamine"]
brand_names = ["Blexten"]
cost = [{ province = "ON", price = "~$1.1 CAD / 20mg tab" }]
coverage = [{ province = "ON", details = "ODB" }]
otc = "no"
moa = "2nd gen H1 receptor antagonist"
half_life = "~15 hours"
peak_action = "~1h, rapid absorption"
routes = "10/20mg tab, 2.5mg/ml liq (uncommon)"
doses = [
  { indication = "CSU, AR", dose = "20mg PO OD to QID", notes = "ages ≥12" },
  { indication = "CSU, AR", dose = "10mg PO OD to QID", notes = "ages 4-11" },
]
age_group = "ages ≥4"
pregnancy = "Avoid (not enough data)"
contraindications = "Hypersensitivity, QT prolongation or history of torsades"
side_effects.common = "QT prolongation (at 100mg ODx4, max mean increase 6ms); drowsiness/headache ~4%[D], ~3%[P]; abdo pain 3%[D], 3%[P]"
side_effects.severe = "Torsades (extremely rare; only 1 case reported in monograph post-market reactions)"
monograph_links = ["/monographs/bilastine_2021_1.pdf"]
abbreviations = "CSU-chronic spontaneous urticaria; AR-allergic rhinitis"
pearls = [
  "Theoretically does not cross BBB; less sedating than other AHs",
  "No renal adjustments needed; minimal data with hepatic impairment but not expected to cause issues",
  "Going beyond OD is technically off-label",
  "Take without food or juice otherwise absorption impaired",
]
```
