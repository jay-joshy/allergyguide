{% admonition(type="tip", icon="tip", title="Appraisal structure") %}
Critical appraisal of primary or secondary literature will have two major sections:

1. A quick and concise need-to-know summary
2. A more detailed breakdown of the paper and assessment of quality of the evidence

{% end %}

# Quick facts

This section should not be longer than half a page at most. It is meant as a quick glance-over refresher about what the take-home points were.

- What is the main clinical question?
- What is the study type?
- What is the population?
- What was the intervention? The therapeutic, diagnostic, or other intervention under investigation (e.g. the experimental intervention, or in observational studies the exposure factor)
- What was the comparison/control (if available)?
- What was the outcome?
- What is the bottom line?
- Study quality (GRADE for reviews, ROB/Newcastle-Ottawa Scale)

### Example

From the [SYGMA2 trial](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1715275) (primary evidence):
