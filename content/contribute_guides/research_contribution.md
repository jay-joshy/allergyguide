{% admonition(type="tip", icon="tip", title="Appraisal structure") %}
Critical appraisal of primary or secondary literature will have two major sections:

1. A quick and concise need-to-know summary
2. A more detailed breakdown of the paper and assessment of quality of the evidence

{% end %}

# Quick facts

This section should not be longer than half a page at most. It is meant as a **quick glance-over refresher** about what the take-home points were. Use highlights to emphasize the key information (ie. the primary outcomes of interest, key exclusions, etc.).

{% two_columns() %}

- What is the main clinical question?
- What is the study type?
- What is the population?
- What was the intervention? The therapeutic, diagnostic, or other intervention under investigation (e.g. the experimental intervention, or in observational studies the exposure factor)

<!-- split -->

- What was the comparison/control (if available)?
- What was the outcome(s)?
- What is the bottom line?
- Quality of evidence (AMSTAR 2 for reviews, RoB-2 for randomized trials primary outcomes)

{% end %}

### Examples

From the [SYGMA2 trial](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1715275) (primary evidence):

# The more detailed review

See the page for the [SYGMA2 trial](/research/sygma2) for an example:

{% two_columns() %}

- Metadata
  - Publish year
  - Journal
  - Funded by
- Authors:
  - Primary: list
  - Reviewers: list
  - Editor: list

<!-- split -->

- What's the clinical question?
- PICO (in more depth)
- Study design (will depend on if primary vs secondary evidence)
- Results
- Limitations
- Conclusion
- Study quality

{% end %}

# Study quality

### ROB-2 -- for randomized trials

See [here](https://methods.cochrane.org/risk-bias-2) for the original tool, and [here](/tools/rob-2/) for easier to navigate tool.

### AMSTAR 2 -- for systematic reviews / meta-analysis
