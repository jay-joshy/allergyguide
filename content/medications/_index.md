Ideally this section is split up into relevant sections, to make it easier to browse:

Antihistamines
Puffers
Nasal sprays
Topical steroids
Moisturizers
DMARDs
Biologics
Misc

That or there's a section up top where you can select the class of medication, and each class is colour themed, and each medication card has a subtle highlight matching those colours

## Medication cards:

{{medications_toml_load()}}
