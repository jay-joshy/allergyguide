# Our goals

To create a comprehensive cross-Canada resident-led and faculty reviewed website for **high-yield and pragmatic** information about clinical allergy & immunology, meant to help residents and fellows in clinic. In particular:

{% important_box_only() %}

1. Sections for major conditions, including copy-pasteable macros and practical pearls
2. Sections for therapies and medications
3. Clinical decision tools
4. Patient resources (a one stop shop for handouts!)

{% end %}

#### Secondary goals (if time permits)

- Sets of questions for RC studying (and maybe an Anki deck)
- Critical appraisal of new research
- Patient resources translated into different languages
