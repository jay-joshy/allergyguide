# Our goals

To create a comprehensive cross-Canada resident-led and faculty reviewed website for **high-yield and pragmatic** information about clinical allergy & immunology. It is meant for **practical use by residents/fellows, or other non-allergist physicians looking to learn**.

{% admonition(type="danger", icon="tip", title="MAIN GOALS") %}

1. Guides for major conditions, including copy-pasteable macros, practical pearls, dealing with common/uncommon scenarios
2. Guides for therapies and quick common medication references
3. Clinical decision tools, clinical quality-of-life tools (ie. [skin testing generator](/tools/spt-generator/)), consent forms
4. Patient resources (a one stop shop for handouts!)
5. Critical appraisal of research

{% end %}

#### Secondary goals (if time permits)

- Deep-dives in separate subpages for more fellow-focused content for each topic
- Informal case reports with well-defined learning points
- Patient resources translated into different languages -- also with specific geographics (ie. BC, ON, etc.)
- Sets of questions for RC studying (and maybe an Anki deck)
- Setting up practice; how to bill (for fellows)
