From respirology block:

Cough is a normal reflex with protective mechanisms. Most people will cough 18-20 times a day NORMALLY.
When people come with chronic cough the goal of symptomatic treatment is not to get RID of the cough but to improve it and their QoL.
The cause of a cough can be varied, but cough by itself can be a 'cause' of cough; you become hypersensitive and cough triggers another cough

Duration
Severity (important to trend over time)
Frequency
Impact
Triggers
Dry vs wet (determines whether you might send for sputum)
Red flags
Medication causes (ie ACEi)
Occupational
Smoking
GERD
Asthma
AR
PNDS symptoms
Previous treatment trials
Current treatment

Ddx: 5 main categories then idiopathic
Asthma
UACS (clearing of throat is a suggestive sign)
GERD
Structural lung disease (ie COPD)
post infectious (months to a yearish)
Then if all else is neg: cough hypersensitivity syndrome

Ix: CBC, IgE
CXR CT chest
PFTs, maybe MCT
Sputum eos / FeNO
bronch is rarely ever helpful

Tx:
First line (not kitchen sink, do one at a time for a month or two to see what will happen first)
Basic: ICS trial
Nasal steroids and sinus rinse
PPI trial
Prednisone short trial consider
Cough diary (ie count the coughs per day so patients understand level of improvement?)

Advanced treatments if things haven't worked already or sig QoL impairments:
Gabapentoids
ie Pregabalin 25-75mg PO BID titrate weekly to target dose of 150mg BID
ie. gabapentin start 100mg TID titrate to 300mg TID target dose x 12 weeks
Opioids: morphine typically
Hycodan syrup
Gefapixant (new cough blockers not yet in Can yet)

because it's a feedback loop there is likely going to be improvement after these drugs are taken away too
less cough = less cough, feedback loop
