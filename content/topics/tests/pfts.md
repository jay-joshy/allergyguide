PFTS include multiple things
spirometry
lung volumes
and DLCO

spirometry is only a PART of PFTS
most of the time spirometry was all u needed for asthma but
now some is RELEVANT... from lung volum es and DLCO

use GLI reference
and use biological sesx rather than gender

further from number and more to Z scores
-1.65 Z score from the mean is more what we want now... for sprio lung volumes and DLCO
this change is happening very slowly

NB:

## lung volumes

in a box, sealed, known volume ...
isert lung volumes chart here
the 6 pants in the beginning help us determine the FRC which then helps us find the RV

definitons for RV, VC, ERV, RV, etc

patterns of disease based on lung volumes:

## DLCO

carbon monoxide used
gas transfer from alveloi into caps
anything that changes that barrier can do that

inretptetiona:
mild: -1.65 to -2.5
molderate: -2.5 to -4
severe etc

low DLCO

- ILD
- ARDS
- COPD with emphysema
- fibrosis

high DLCO

- asthma
- pulmonary hemorrahge
- obesity

## spirometry

really need to breath COMPLETELY out
you get the FV loop

- volume over time graph
  etc

what's the peak point in the FV loop?
near the y axis
it';s the PEAK flow.
need to make sure they reach peak flow (sharp vertx) otherwise test might not be great
