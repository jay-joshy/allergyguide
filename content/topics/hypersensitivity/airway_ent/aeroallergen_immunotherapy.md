Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is an effective treatment for allergic rhinitis/conjunctivitis (AR/AC), allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis with aeroallergen sensitization (ie, dust mites), and stinging-insect hypersensitivity. **Patients should demonstrate specific IgE antibodies to relevant allergens to which they are allergic, either by skin testing or appropriate in vitro tests.** There are no specific age limits; however, children should be able to communicate effectively, and comorbidities in elderly should be considered. **Duration of therapy should be patient individualized, but most guidelines recommend 3–5 years of maintenance therapy for aeroallergens (repeat skin or blood testing not recommended).** AIT may be given indefinitely for severe stinging-insect hypersensitivity, particularly in patients with severe reactions or systemic mastocytosis.

# Perennial SCIT

two phases: a build-up phase (also known as up-dosing or induction) and a maintenance phase.

## Build up/Induction/Updosing - 4 - 6 months

During the build-up phase, the patient receives weekly injections, starting with a very low dose, with gradual increases in dose over the course of 4–6 months. The frequency of injections during this phase generally ranges from 1 to 3 times per week, although more rapid build-up schedules are sometimes used. After this period, the patient has usually built up sufficient tolerance to the allergen such that a maintenance (therapeutic) dose has been reached.

## Maintenance phase

During the maintenance phase, the patient generally receives injections of the maintenance dose every 4 weeks for inhalant allergens, usually for a period of 3–5 years. After this period, many patients experience a prolonged, protective effect and, therefore, consideration can be given to stopping therapy, depending on risk factors for recurrence in the case of venom immunotherapy.

TODO: double check this: During allergen season, no updosing of buildup phase for that allergen, just monthly. afterwards buildup until mainenance.

NB: each time the vials are switched the dose has to be cut at least 50% because there is degradation of the vials once the diluant is added.
caution: manufactuer vials lot to lot can also change, which is also why the dose is cut
can be significant differences in potency

# Seasonal AIT

Sometimes it is performed for seasonal allergens on a seasonal basis. For example, you may start giving tree AIT in December of Janurary (2-3 months prior to the season beginning), before stopping once the season is over.

# Differences between SLIT and SCIT

- Allergens available. SLIT is only for grasses (Orarlair, Grastek), birch (Itaultek), dust mite (Acaratax), ragweed (Ragwitek)
- Risk of anaphylaxis is essentially zero for SLIT but ~1/1000 for SCIT

> To my knowledge: no head to head efficacy comparison between seasonal AIT and perennial
