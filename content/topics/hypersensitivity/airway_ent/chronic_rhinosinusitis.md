CRS is a complex inflammatory syndrome with two subtypes: CRSwNP and CRSsNP. Diagnosis requires both structural evidence of sinus inflammation and some cardinal symptoms (congestion/fullness, facial pain/pressure, nasal obstruction/blockage, and purulent drainage). Preliminary workup involves CT sinus and/or nasal endoscopy and aeroallergen testing. Management includes trigger avoidance and saline rinses; INCS, consideration of dupilumab for CRSwNP, and treatment of underlying causes.
