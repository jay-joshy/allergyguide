CRS is a complex inflammatory syndrome with two subtypes: CRSwNP and CRSsNP. Diagnosis requires both structural evidence of sinus inflammation and some cardinal symptoms (congestion/fullness, facial pain/pressure, nasal obstruction/blockage, and purulent drainage). Workup and management involves either CT sinus and/or nasal endoscopy
