?GERD?

Asthma

- Symptoms of *** with PFTs showing *** are consistent with a diagnosis of asthma
  (increase in FEV1 and/or FVC ≥12 % over baseline and ≥200 mL with bronchodilation)
- phenotype is felt to be allergic/eosinophilic/nonallergic/ intermittent (exercise induced vs. occupational vs. viral induced)
- Symptoms are currently uncontrolled/partly controlled/controlled on **meds** with **compliance/technique**
  (>2 daytime, woken up at night, activity limitation, rescue >2)
- Relevant comorbidities include rhinosinusitis, OSA, GERD, obesity, and depression.

* Baseline spirometry, SPT, FeNO
* Methacholine / Exercise challenge test given diagnostic uncertainty
* Ad-hoc: OSA study

> Comorbid conditions that can exacerbate symptoms should be optimized. These include smoking, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, nasal polyps, allergic rhinitis, anxiety, de-conditioning, viruses, and pollution exposure
> Pharmacologically:

- Symbicort 200/6 1 puff PRN (up to 8 puffs/daily) for mild intermittent asthma or issues with adherence (as per the SYGMA2 trial)
- Symbicort 200/6 1-2 puffs BID
- Triple therapy with: Breo Ellipta 100/25 or 200/25 mcg 1 puff daily
- If in exacerbation: prednisone 50mg PO OD x 5 days with a taper, vs present to the ED

> We reviewed the importance of adherence to medications with proper technique
> As they are well controlled, we discussed stepping down therapy to:
