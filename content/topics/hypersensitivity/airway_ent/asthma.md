HPI:
Started:
Symptoms: wheezing/cough/chest tightness/SOBOE
Triggers: exercise, cold air, irritants (perfumes), aeroallergens, pets, infections, medications, laughing
Mainly night vs day
Daytime /week
Waking up at night? / week
Puffers:
Rescue / week
missing work/school
Response to SABAs, ICS, Montelukast, Prednisone was nil/weak/fair/substantial. Never required prednisone, ER visits, hospitalization, ICU admission, or intubation/mechanical ventilation
?GERD?

Asthma

- Symptoms of *** with PFTs showing *** are consistent with a diagnosis of asthma
  (increase in FEV1 and/or FVC ≥12 % over baseline and ≥200 mL with bronchodilation)
- phenotype is felt to be allergic/eosinophilic/nonallergic/ intermittent (exercise induced vs. occupational vs. viral induced)
- Symptoms are currently uncontrolled/partly controlled/controlled on **meds** with **compliance/technique**
  (>2 daytime, woken up at night, activity limitation, rescue >2)
- Relevant comorbidities include rhinosinusitis, OSA, GERD, obesity, and depression.

PLAN:
=> We will pursue spirometry / Methacholine challenge testing / exercise challenge / SPT / OSA study
=> We discussed management of comorbid conditions that can exacerbate symptoms including smoking, obesity, dysfunctional breathing, obstructive sleep apnea, nasal polyps, allergic rhinitis, anxiety, de-conditioning, viruses, and pollution exposure.
=> We reviewed the importance of adherence to medications with proper technique.
=> Pharmacologic control therapy detailed below:

Anti-Inflammatory Strategy-Symbicort 200/6 mcg 1 puff prn up to 8 puffs/day for mild intermittent asthma with no exacerbation risk factors.
SMART Strategy-Symbicort 200/6 mcg 2 puffs bid + PRN up to 8 puffs/day.
Patients with adherence issues - Breo Ellipta 100/25 or 200/25 mcg 1 puff daily.

GINA guidelines, >12 years of age:
Step 1: Low dose budesonide-formoterol PRN
Alternatives: SABA PRN taken with low dose ICS PRN
Step 2: Daily Low dose ICS + PRN SABA
or PRN Low dose budesonide-formoterol Alternatives: SABA PRN taken with low dose ICS PRN; daily low
dose LTRA
Step 3: Maintenance Low dose ICS/LABA +
PRN low dose ICS-formoterol Alternatives: med dose ICS +SABA, low dose ICS-LTRA
Step 4: Maintenance medium dose ICS-LABA + PRN low dose ICS-formoterol
Alternatives: high dose ICS+SABA; add on tiotroprium; add on LTRA
Step 5: Maintenance high dose ICS-LABA and Refer for add-on treatment (e.g. tiotropium, omalizumab, mepolizumab)

Well controlled:
In regards to his asthma, the patient feels that his symptoms are currently well controlled and declined spirometry today. We would be happy to see for follow up lung function testing should he have any further concerns regarding asthma management.
