AP:

- Skin testing prior to intradermal may be considered if hx of anaphylaxis
- Otherwise, intradermal testing doses are titrated up until positive result (gives baseline for venom therapy)
  *** A skin test may be negative in the days or weeks after a sting reaction, which may be attributed to a refractory period of anergy; for these patients, the skin test should be repeated after 4–6 weeks

***non systemic reactions
.The symptoms often last a few days to a week. The risk of a systemic reaction with a subsequent sting is about 5-10% which is only slightly higher than the general population (2-5%). Because of the low risk immunotherapy is not necessary but may be offered if the patient gets stung often and has frequent reactions as it will decrease the severity of the large local reactions.

***confirmed venom allergy
Systemic reactions to stinging insects have a 30-60% risk of a subsequent potentially life threatening reaction with another sting.
-The allergen of concern was identified today as

- Recommended to measure tryptase in severe reaction to a sting, hypotensive reaction, lack of urticaria in systemic reaction to a sting, and systemic reaction to a sting with negative venom IgE.
  -Immunotherapy is the treatment of choice, and indicated for patients with clinical history of anaphylaxis to insect sting and evidence of venom- specific IgE with skin test or serologic testing, unless there are specific contraindications, and can reduce the risk back down to about 5% once the patients are on maintenance dosing.
  -As such, immunotherapy to was suggested today to
  -VIT administered 1-2 times per week with starting dose 1μg; Dosing is generally monthly for 12-18 months, 6-8 weeks until 4 years, every 12 weeks after 4 years
  -We have counseled on sting avoidance techniques such as not eating/drinking outside, wearing shoes when walking in the grass and having nests professionally removed from the property.
