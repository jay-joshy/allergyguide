IgE mediated
maybe just local reaction?

esters vs amides
esters are nonovaine benzocaine coacine
amides are lidocaine articaine marcaine

?topicals may sensitize? unclear

benzocaine is known for allergic contact dermatitis

systemic reactions to local anesthic are either from inadevertent injection into the loodstream and expefted effects
vs a true IgE which is quite rare usually

testing:
?SPT then IDT? patch testing? I forget
