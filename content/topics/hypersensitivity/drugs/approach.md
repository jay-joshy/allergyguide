## Summary:

WIP

# WIP

## Basic classifcation

ADRs can be broken down into Type A and B (we are concerned mainly about type B)

- Type A is dose dependent and predictable - expected side effects based on pharmacologic properties of the drug
- Type B is either immunologic or non immunologic
  - Non-immunologic: Idiosyncratic vs mast cell mediated (pseudoallergy)
    - Link to non-ige mediated reactions (ie. direct mast cell, complement activation, IgG mediated, cytokine release reaction)
    - Can occur on first exposure; skin testing is negative; may have atypical symptoms, and may not be reproducible...
  - Immunologic: ie type I - IV

## Gel and coombs

> This should be listed in a table in the document

### Type 1 DHR

### Type II

Antibody mediated
usually hemolytic anemias
you usually will not see this

### Type III

Complement mediated reaction and antibody complexes
Serum sickness and vasculitis are classic examples

### IV

Link to page

The baddie of the world
T cell mediated +/- macrophages, eos, or neutrophils
DELAYED onset, days to weeks
Prominent skin findings are the classic manifestation
large variance in clinical severity on presentation

Morbiliform drug reaction, AGEP, DRESS, SJS/TENS

## Approach general

History

- rash, mucosa, systemic involvement
- TIMING (latency, recent vs remote)
- treatment - severe or mild, anaphylaxis?
- use before or after

RED FLAGS

- fever
- SCAR type rashes, blistering, desqumation during ACUTE phase (not healing phase)
- other end organ involvement

what's the risk
type of allergy
additional testing?
recommendations

## Drug allergy testing basics

SPT, IDT, patch testing,

Immediate reaction history:

- SPT/IDT
- only penicillin (drug major + minor) has good NPV
- other testing has limited evidence

# section for other drugs until another page is made:

## iron reactions

Mechanisms: IgE (fairly rare), direct mast cell activation, Fishbane reaction (usually consist of acute chest and back tightness and joint pain without severe symptoms, such as hypotension, wheezing, stridor, or laryngeal edema)
Testing: no skin tests are reliable in this case. Only an IV challenge is helpful.
Management:

1. if direct mast cell => usually try another agent and go very slow
2. if Fishbane, can stop infusion for 15 mins and observe and treat with Tylenol; if improves can run slower

## NSAID

generally NSAID induced AAE occurs within 2-3 hours of NSAID ingestion

```
Ddx is true IgE mediated vs pharmcologic class effect

-Isolated urticaria within 2 hours of NSAID ingestion on repeated exposures is consistent with NSAID induced urticaria which is a cyclo-oxygenase -1 (COX-1) mediated reaction (pharmacologic class effect).
-Consider challenge with celebrex whcih is a cox-2 selective
-As such, we have advised to continue to avoid all NSAIDs moving forward as at higher doses they may cause repeated urticaria. 
-They can continue to take tylenol without issue. 
-Should he require NSAIDs in the future (beyond topical and low doses which can be administered without issue) he can be re-assessed with a supervised challenge

The patient does not have a history of asthma or nasal polyps
The patient does not have a history of chronic urticaria
Their reaction is most in keeping with COX-1 mediated
