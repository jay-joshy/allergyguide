CMPA: bloody stool first few months life no FTT prognosis good
FPIE: diarheaa, abdo pain, distention
EDU:

The only true diagnostic test for FPIES or similar non-IgE mediated reactions is an oral challenge; however, this is only usually done if history is insufficient.

> Although unpleasant, these non-IgE reactions are not associated with progression to anaphylaxis and as such no epinephrine autoinjector is needed
