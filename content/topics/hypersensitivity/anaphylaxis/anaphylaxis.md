# +++ defintions

WAO one is quite good
I like the 2 defintions, simple, probably easier for patients

# some pearls:

Reactions are like a roulette. It is difficult to predict who will have a severe anaphylaxis episode vs mild
it seems most cases of severe fatal anaphylaxis seem to display their first symptoms in 30 mins post ingestion

# risk of death

around 1 in 1 million

# cofactors:

exercise
alcohol
infections
drugs (ie NSAIDs)
emotional stress

# risk factors for severe anaphylaxis

asthma
on antihypertn
cardiovascular diseases
mast cell disorders already

# ddx

vasovagal
vocal cord
severe asthma
PE
axiety
MI
etc...

# anaphylaxis grading is variable and split ...

see WAO for their one

# testing

Trytpase
proteinase released by mast cells >>> basophils
there is alpha and beta immature protryptase and mature tryptase
with degranulation mature tryptases are released by mast cells

our test is a ELISA for 'total' trytpase
max elevation 30-90 mins after onset anaphylaxis but still worth trying...
correlations with hypotension in insect sting allergy
should compare to baseline if possible

normal is 1-11.4
systemic is >1.2 + 2 of baseline
. >20 systemic mastocytosis
. >8 is HAT, mostly >11

there is some data that shows a high tyrptase is a specific but NOT sensitive marker
? 50% sensivity ...

# management

beyond EPI
preLOAD is important
there are big changes in stroke volume and CO
while HR goes up, stroke volume and preload go down

IV fluids bolus

start IV epi if refractory to a few doses of IM epi
0.1ml of 1:1000 epi and add 0.9ml of NS
1 in 10k dilution
infuse it over 30-60s

doses:

> 12 0.5ml of 1:1000 epi
> 6-12 0.3 ml of 1mg/ml 1:1000 epi
> 0.15 for 1-5

in canada we go by weight tbh
but this is from WAO

epipen and epipen junior
junir is 0.15mg <30kg to 15kg... not great
otherwise is 0.3

our opinion is 0.5mg is the better dose... IM

NEFFY
nasal spray
has some slcial chemical to allow epi to be asborebd easier through nasal mucoass
seems to have a pretty good absroption profile voer time compared to autoinjector at least from componay data...

see cochrane review biphasic anaphylxais steroids
limited relief

# more pealrs

needle legnth is important for peds/adult
don't be afriad to treat anaphylxais even if BP is high
BB and epi with alpha oppostino should be kept in mind
