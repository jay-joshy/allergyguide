Atopic dermatitis. Current control: 

> Regular moisturization (at least BID) is a crucial part of management; there is strong evidence it reduces disease severity and need for prescription creams. We reviewed options such as (but not limited to) Vaseline, CeraVe, or Cetaphil creams
> For disease flares we suggest:
  - Betaderm 0.1% ointment BID to body and Desonide 0.05% cream BID to face (or Protopic 0.1% ointment BID to face), until clear of ezcema; then switching to maintenance schedule
  - Maintenance schedule: application of topicals 2-3x/weekly to eczema-prone areas; can consider taper to OTC moisturization with sustained control
> If symptoms are refractory, we can consider systemic therapies such as Dupilimab and further investigate for mimickers such as allergic contact dermatitis, cutaneous T cell lymphoma, scabies, or immunodeficiency
