# Presentation

Lots of variability in how it presents, nummular, extensor, flexor ... this varies by age as well
skin tone also changes appearance

Other findings:

- Follicular prominence (looks like they have goosebumps)
- Post inflammatory pigmentary change (hypopigmentation)
- Hyper-linear palms, especially more noticeable in kids > adults

## infected?

weepy look
toxins with superanigen effect with atph bc it's up to 90% of skin lesions
use bleach baths + antibiotics

# Pathophysiology

Normal skin: blocks irritants and allergens
Mild AD: barrier changes, irritants and allergens make their way into the skin
Flaring: Staph colonization, worsened barrier, loss of water
Many of those barrier changes are relevant to the immune system... it's overactive
Natures reviews 2022 has a good review article on this

For patients: 1) barrier disruption 2) immune system dysregulation

# Why care

Chronic relapsing, frustrating, sleep deprivation, financial burden ...
Plus they get advice unsolicited from every single person ...

# Epidemiology

Atopic conditions obviously
Also depression
Also autoimmunity

# Differential diagnosis

- Scabies
- Contact dermatitis
- Ichthyoisis
- sebhorric derm
- psoriastic
-

# Atopic dermatitis and food allergies

Very commonly held perception ...
Food allergies do NOT cause AD
AD might increase risk of food allergies
May be some flares of AD with some foods...? but this is not the typical IgE pathyway
VERY VERY rarely has derm ever seen removal of a food help with it

# Management

See 2019 Journal of cutaneous medicine and surgery: atopic dermatitis mild to mod
There's a great flowchart

1. Fix protective function with moisturizer - thicker, at least creams
   avoid contact with triggers - no bubble baths, fragrance, no dryer sheets
   Rinse after swimming

2. Use medicine to calm the immune ystem
   BID during flare until compeltel clear
   BID to recurrent areas as part of amintenance
   Topical steroids, calcineurin inhib, PDE4 inhib

Ezecma care plan
Eczema society of canada has one

# Treatments

Some definitions:

- FTU: Fingertip unit - strip / line, enough to cover two palms worth
- Size of container matters. Ie. 250g tubs for hydrocort, or 150-200 for betamethasone. ie. a 50g tub if hydrcort should last <1 week if using the correct amount

## Topical steroids

Hydrocort can go ANYWHERE
Betaderm not for face but rest of body ok
Mometasone ok for body
clobetasol very potent, limited areas only, thick skin only, no face

You can mix and match stronger steroids with the nydrcort ...
ie if there is hetergencity in severity in distrub

Alcohol analogy
Different alcohols have different strength
long term use blah
clobetasol is your vodka
mometasone/betamethason: beer/wine, use for a few weeks, probably not every day for months and months
Hortcort - like kombucha, use whatever whenerver

OD vs BID vs PRN

## Topical non steroids

- Calcineruin inhibiotrrs (tacro, pimecrolimus)
- PDE4 inhbiotrs (crisborole, romflumilast)
- JAKi (ruxolinib) - selective JAK1 JAK2 inhibiotr
- Aryl hydrocarbon receptor modulating agent (tapinarof not yet available)

## ithcing dealing with

- AH not thattt helpful, cause not histmaine really
- keeping them cool at night bc hot can increase itch
- exposed skin tends to be scratched more - long sleeves long pants
- for teenagers, artifical nails sometimes

## Biologics / systemic therapy

NBUVB first
Then MTX CsA MMF or AZA immune modulators
PRednisone ONLY as a rescue do not use if possible
biologics / Jaki

Funding is kinda wack province to province

dupi - very well toelrated... but 5% conjunctivits, 12% skin infections vs 24% placebo, no routine blood monitoring ... vaccinations ok on it too
