# approach

prefer mcmac simple approach overall

1. is it actually hives
2. triggers
3. duration
4. red flags
   something else

# What are hives? There is a STRICT defintion

- pruritic
- wheal and flare (pale central clearing with surrounding erythema), but NOT always the case
- should be blanchable
- TRANSIENT (<24-48h)
- superficial dermis
- papules/plaques

# Categorization of hives

- acute
- chronic (>6w)
  - inducible
  - spontaneous

CSU (called CIU in the past)

- recurrent spont hives +/- angioedema
- MOST days of the weeks for at least 6 weeks

# CSU Epidemiology

- affects up to 1/20 of people during their lives
- not much mortality but it sucks to have
- average age of diagnosis is 30-40 years
- adults >children, mainly F
- is correlated with autoimmune disease in general

50% just isolated urtic
40% with episodic angioedema
10% isolated angioedema

CURE registry:
59% with BOTH
36% wheals alone
5% angioedema alone

# Pathophysiology

Eventually mast cells become activated
lots of potential pathways to this however
but nothing strongly established or known with great certainity
it's not confirmed 'autoimmune'

Some of these can include:

- IgG trigger to surface bound IgE similar to an allergen
- IgG binding surface receptors
- self antigen that causes IgE cross linking

# Differential

CIU
urticaial calsuitis
mastocuytoiss
schnitzelr syndrome
familial cold autoinflammatory sybndrome
muckle wells syndreom
purritic urtical paules and plaques of pregnancy
atopic dermaitis ,ertyehma multiforme, cut lupus ... etc

# Testing

differs by org

EAACI: limited at frist, CBC with ESR and CRP
choosing widely; no routine, only with clincal indication
others: BAT, ASST, skin biopsy ...

Usually in practice these patients often do end up getting a panel skin test for aeroallergens
but this is NOT correct... ie. you should not be testing for EVERY single food for example and give false information

# Treatment

## Education

Not a sign of impedning anaphylxis
it is common and mostly BENIGN
self resolving
QoL solutions in the interim exist that are quite safe and widely used

## nonpharm

Avoid triggers
stress reduction
medications to avoid include nonspecific mast cell activators
foods (contrevesial, ie EtOH, though should avoid anyway)

? low histatmine diet
... contrevesial... please see some derm journals on trhis...

## pharm

there is sometimes use of oral steroids acutely to treat flares... but would try to avoid if at ALL possible
(can increase risk of recurrence after too...)

1-4x 2nd gen AH; aim is COMPLETE control
omalizumab next if fails
if fails move to changing dose or frequency of omalizumab
cyclosporine last line ...
but new guidelines coming soon, might be dupi soon as well... also BTK inhibirtor remibrutinib

LOVELY graph given in slides re: step up and step down options and what markers suggest success with each option

Look at network meta analysis for different types of 2nd gen antihistmines

# monitoring progress and severity

UAS score
ColdUAS
CholUAS
urticaria control test
CU-Q2oL

# Prognosis

From eruopean data

- 50% may resolve within 6 months of onset
- 20% in 3 years
- 20% in 5-10 years
- <2% within 25 years, sometimes very longstanding

# CIU

## Cold induced

typically within min utes and lasts for hour sih
ice cube testing
caution with significant epxouisrs aresulting in more systemic symptoms

## cholingeric

exerfcise, passive rewarming, emotional stress, spicy foods etc
papular, short lived
provocation testing with exercise, warm clothing/room
hives wihtin 10ish minutes of exposure?

## Management

similar
some ?desnsitivetion but contreversial

# The atypicals

## urticarial vasculitis
