To add to macro:

HAE I or II
Treatment of acute attacks

- ie Berinent, Firazyr

pearl:
study from germany on deaths
phase 1 2 3
1 first sx
2 dyspnea
3 about to die
if tx stage 1 then good outcome
otherwise poor.
treat EARLY.

Prophylaxis
if more frequent attacks
not specific threhosld
but funded if 3x in a month
or any SEVERE attack life-threatening etc

procedures
does require surgical or dental procedures, she will need prophylactic therapy with C1 inhibitor to prevent angioedema attack.

triggers
We reviewed that there are certain medications that she will need to avoid as they interfere with bradykinin metabolism and could precipitate life-threatening angioedema attacks. These include: ACE inhibitors, Neprilysin inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors and Estrogens. She does not currently have indications for any of these medications.

HPI:
ACEi or NSAIDs
Exposures, triggers (foods, hormones, stress, meds, trauma)
duration, speed of swelling, relation to exposure timing
location of swelling
when was the first episode
abdo pain, systemic symptoms, rashes, arthralgias, vitiligo
family history
Urticaria

- Work up: C3/C4, C1-INH level and function, C1q; SPEP, CBC, Cr, Calcium/Albumin

> We have advised the importance of avoiding stress, limiting alcohol, and no NSAID use
> In the interim, we will start empiric treatment with second generation antihistamines; undifferentiated angioedema may still be mast-cell mediated.

- Rx: Blexten 40mg PO BID

*** confirmed HAE
=> acute mgment: C1-INH concentrate (Berinert), Bradykinin receptor antagonist Icatibant (FIRAZYR®), plasma kallikrein inhibition Lanadelumab (TAKHZYRO®), present to ED
=> long term prophylaxis: C1-INH, ?androgrens but AEs

*** AAE ACEi supportive care, avoid ACEi and Entresto, ARBs ok in a pinch

# rough

## classification

with or without urticaria
with comes down to chronic vs acute
without some down to AAE and HAE
AAE might be: NSAID, ACEi
HAE has its own classifaciotns into type I II and III
with their own epid, ie. II is 15, I is 85%, and III is something?

this is the old way of classication but if you look at the new DANCE criteria it is a bit different

## Pathophys

Depends but the old school thought is bradykinin mediated vs histmaine mediated
where pro bradykinin can happenw tih c1est def vs something else (ie impaired degration with ACEi)

triggers possible can vary
