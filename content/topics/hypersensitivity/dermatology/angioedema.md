# Definitions

Angioedema: subcutaneous and/or submucosal swelling; mainly skin, GI tract, upper airways; secondary to sudden and localized vascular permeability and vasodilation

# Mechanisms

Probably other mechanisms involved that we don't know about.
Mainly two categories we know of however:

1. Histamine mediated
2. Bradykinin mediated. Short half-life (17), metabolized mainly by ACE, but also by neutral endopeptidase (NEP or Neprilysin); secondarily things like DPP4

- So things like Entresto might cause it too, or things like DPP4 i (particularly sitagliptin)
- TpA can also cause it, 2% of patients

# Categories

## Mast cell mediated angioedema

Usually allergic: Food, NSAIDS, insect stings, urticaria associated

Can be:

- CSU (with or without hives), also called idiopathic histaminergic angioedema or idiopathic mast cell mediated angioedema
  - Distinction: histaminergic mediated => should respond to continuous antihistamines; mast cell mediated => doesn't respond to antihistamines but does to omalizumab
  - Can also have delayed pressure urticaria/angioedema which may last up to 72h and can be associated with burning/pain, usually 4-6 hours AFTER pressure stimulus
- It can be pruritc and/or painful
- Interestingly, most of these are not life threatening; ie not going to obstruct upper airway

> RE: CSU - 10% have ONLY angioedema. 50% only hives; 40% both hives and angioedema

Regardless:, in terms of treatment:

- anti IgE is quite helpful for BOTH urticaria and angioedema

## Bradykinin mediated - HAE type I and II

Epid: any race/gender
Pathophys: deficiency in C1-INH amount or function

Presentation:
Usually has non-pitting circumscribed painful edema; if upper airway CAN be life threatening
Also can have abdomina pain from bowel wall edema, almost mimicking bowel wall edema

Triggers:
Trauma
Menstration
Surgical procedures
Medications: estrogen, ACEi
Stress
Infection
Pregnancy

> PEARL: Can develop a non-urticarial rash that can occur almost like a prodrome in any place, may be hours/days before the attack

## HAE type III - normal C1-INH and C4

RARE.
Most are type I around 85%; the rest is type II, ; global study
some canada specific data shows there's more tpye III but ? overdiagnose or innapropiate?

Diagnostic criteria:

- Episodic angioedema without urticaria (abdominal pain COUNTS!) if they get a CT scan during that time its very helpful
- Normal C1-INH and C4
- Family history OR relevant genetics for this condition (there are a few)
  - FXII mutation - mainly women affected, depends on high estrogen exposure; classically appears when starting OCPs or becoming pregant; for men half are symptomatic
  - PLG-HAE; median age 20, mainly face and tongue swelling
  - 4 more ... then unknown
- Other causes excluded

## Acquired angioedema

Similar to HAE I or II but usually later in life it presents
It is very rare though
autoantibodies to or consumption of normal C1-INH
ie associated with lymphoproliferative disorders, MGUS, AI diseases
similar triggers to HAE

| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
|                    | HAE Type I    | HAE Type II   |                        |                                 |

| **C1q**            | Normal        | Normal        | Low (70% of cases)     | Normal                          |

Note: C1q depending on the province can be quite hard to actually order
Also note the 50% cutoff for the C1-INH level and function; the test is quite fragile and there often has be shipping towards special labs; if not handled properly you can have slightly low C1 even in a normal person
You also need at least 2 abnormal values at least 1 mo apart

### ACEi mediated

only 0.1 to 0.7% of patients
commonly involves the mouth
Bradykinin mediated
66% occurs within first 3 months of therapy, but afterwards the remaining % could occur up to YEARs later
there is a washout period even after stopping; can occur up to 1-2 months after stopping

## Bradkinin or non mast cell mediated

Normal c1h, not responsive to antihistamines or anti IgE, doesn't meet criteria for HAE III
we call it bradykinin (idiopathic Bradykinin mediated angioedema) if responsive to typical treatments such as TXA, C1 in, Icatibant
if not responsive; idiopathic non mast cell (which is a big umberlla term otherwise)

# Angioedema differential

Throat symptoms:

- VCD, GERD, post nasal drip

- SVC syndrome
- Orofacial granulomatosis
- Morbus morbihan
- systemic capillary leak syndrmoe
- Eosinophilic disorders

> Trick: palpate the tongue; should be like a pancake, thi
> If you trigger gag reflex the tongue; if tognue togally retacts you're good

# Cases

# macro

To add to macro:

HAE I or II
Treatment of acute attacks

- ie Berinent, Firazyr

pearl:
study from germany on deaths
phase 1 2 3
1 first sx
2 dyspnea
3 about to die
if tx stage 1 then good outcome
otherwise poor.
treat EARLY.

Prophylaxis
if more frequent attacks
not specific threhosld
but funded if 3x in a month
or any SEVERE attack life-threatening etc

procedures
does require surgical or dental procedures, she will need prophylactic therapy with C1 inhibitor to prevent angioedema attack.

triggers
We reviewed that there are certain medications that she will need to avoid as they interfere with bradykinin metabolism and could precipitate life-threatening angioedema attacks. These include: ACE inhibitors, Neprilysin inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors and Estrogens. She does not currently have indications for any of these medications.

HPI:
ACEi or NSAIDs
Exposures, triggers (foods, hormones, stress, meds, trauma)
duration, speed of swelling, relation to exposure timing
location of swelling
when was the first episode
abdo pain, systemic symptoms, rashes, arthralgias, vitiligo
family history
Urticaria

- Work up: C3/C4, C1-INH level and function, C1q; SPEP, CBC, Cr, Calcium/Albumin

> We have advised the importance of avoiding stress, limiting alcohol, and no NSAID use
> In the interim, we will start empiric treatment with second generation antihistamines; undifferentiated angioedema may still be mast-cell mediated.

- Rx: Blexten 40mg PO BID

*** confirmed HAE
=> acute mgment: C1-INH concentrate (Berinert), Bradykinin receptor antagonist Icatibant (FIRAZYR®), plasma kallikrein inhibition Lanadelumab (TAKHZYRO®), present to ED
=> long term prophylaxis: C1-INH, ?androgrens but AEs

*** AAE ACEi supportive care, avoid ACEi and Entresto, ARBs ok in a pinch

# rough

## classification

with or without urticaria
with comes down to chronic vs acute
without some down to AAE and HAE
AAE might be: NSAID, ACEi
HAE has its own classifaciotns into type I II and III
with their own epid, ie. II is 15, I is 85%, and III is something?

this is the old way of classication but if you look at the new DANCE criteria it is a bit different

## Pathophys

Depends but the old school thought is bradykinin mediated vs histmaine mediated
where pro bradykinin can happenw tih c1est def vs something else (ie impaired degration with ACEi)

triggers possible can vary
