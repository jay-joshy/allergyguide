## classification

with or without urticaria
with comes down to chronic vs acute
without some down to AAE and HAE
AAE might be: NSAID, ACEi
HAE has its own classifaciotns into type I II and III
with their own epid, ie. II is 15, I is 85%, and III is something?

this is the old way of classication but if you look at the new DANCE criteria it is a bit different

## Pathophys

Depends but the old school thought is bradykinin mediated vs histmaine mediated
where pro bradykinin can happenw tih c1est def vs something else (ie impaired degration with ACEi)

triggers possible can vary
