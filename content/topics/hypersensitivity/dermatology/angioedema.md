<div class="blur-container">

# macro

HPI:
ACEi or NSAIDs
Exposures, triggers (foods, hormones, stress, meds, trauma)
duration, speed of swelling, relation to exposure timing
location of swelling
when was the first episode
abdo pain, systemic symptoms, rashes, arthralgias, vitiligo
family history
Urticaria

- Work up: C3/C4, C1-INH level and function, C1q; SPEP, CBC, Cr, Calcium/Albumin

> We have advised the importance of avoiding stress, limiting alcohol, and no NSAID use
> In the interim, we will start empiric treatment with second generation antihistamines; undifferentiated angioedema may still be mast-cell mediated.

- Rx: Blexten 40mg PO BID

*** confirmed HAE
=> acute mgment: C1-INH concentrate (Berinert), Bradykinin receptor antagonist Icatibant (FIRAZYR®), plasma kallikrein inhibition Lanadelumab (TAKHZYRO®), present to ED
=> long term prophylaxis: C1-INH, ?androgrens but AEs

*** AAE ACEi supportive care, avoid ACEi and Entresto, ARBs ok in a pinch

# rough

## classification

with or without urticaria
with comes down to chronic vs acute
without some down to AAE and HAE
AAE might be: NSAID, ACEi
HAE has its own classifaciotns into type I II and III
with their own epid, ie. II is 15, I is 85%, and III is something?

this is the old way of classication but if you look at the new DANCE criteria it is a bit different

## Pathophys

Depends but the old school thought is bradykinin mediated vs histmaine mediated
where pro bradykinin can happenw tih c1est def vs something else (ie impaired degration with ACEi)

triggers possible can vary
