## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

- ASCII export for protocols no longer outputs a table as it looks bad on non-mono-font EMRs by default.

Old output example:

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed

- on mobile, format of clickwrap modal is now not cut off
- on mobile, table is now auto x-scroll

### Security

## [0.9.1] - 2025-12-09

### Added

- Small footnote explaining what the +/- buttons do
- Added another checkbox to clickwrapper: verification that food protein content(s) require manual check and that searchable foods are not guaranteed to be accurate
- Added small footer under protein content inputs Food A and B reminding user to always verify concentration with the Nutrition Facts label

### Changed

- When typing, the search bar shows: "Create Custom Food: <...>" instead of just "Custom:"
- Debounce time for food name changing is now longer

### Fixed

- Bug: users could input negative or null/NaN values in Food A or B thresholds. Values are now clamped and revert to 0
- Bug: users could leave input fields in the table (Protein target, Mix Food, Mix Water, Daily Amount) blank or NaN leading to unintended behaviour: the user sees an empty box, but the internal state retains the previous number. Now, it becomes 0

## [0.9.0] - 2025-12-08

### Added

- UserHistory system: Embed QR code in export PDF containing a log of actions taken to make protocol. **No PHI data is within the action log**; the custom note is also not stored.
- On initialization, if loading of the food/protocol databases fail for whatever reason, the tool will no longer silently fail; tool will now not be usable
- New DUPLICATE_STEP warning: Flags redundant adjacent steps with the same food and target protein
- New HIGH_DAILY_AMOUNT warning: Flags daily protein amounts exceeding an upper limit (yellow warning), 250 g or ml
- New HIGH_MIX_WATER warning: Flags mix water volumes exceeding an upper limit (yellow warning), 500 ml
- Data integrity checks: on startup, validates all food and protocol data to prevent potential calculation errors caused by malformed database entries

### Changed

- INVALID_CONCENTRATION warning: Flags if protein content > serving size (previously this was not explicitly flagged)

### Fixed

- Fixed bug where Undo/Redo operations failed to update text inputs (e.g., Food Name) if the input field was still focused

## [0.8.0] - 2025-12-07

### Added

- **Protocol**:
  - Dosing Strategies: "Standard" and "Slow" presets
  - Customization: ability to add/remove individual steps and manually edit protein targets or daily amounts directly within the table
  - Transition Logic: automated "Food A to Food B" transitions (e.g., dilute solution to whole food) with customizable protein thresholds
  - Toggle support for both solid and liquid foods with automatic unit conversion
  - Custom notes field that persists to exports

- **Food and protocol**:
  - Foods available from CNF 2015 database with fuzzy-search
  - A few pre-built protocols available with fuzzy-search
  - Support for custom food creation

- **Dilution calculations**:
  - Automatic calculation of amounts/volumes to ensure protein targets are met within measurement constraints
  - Flexible food A strategies: Support for "Initial Dilution," "Dilution Throughout," or "No Dilution" workflows

- **Protocol validation**:
  - Real-time Validation rule set on protocols, red/yellow. Not fully completed yet

- **User experience**:
  - Undo/Redo History: Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y for protocol changes

- **Exports and compliance**:
  - Debugging / versioning: commit-hash stamping on PDF footers for version tracking
  - Terms of Use: clickwrap modal before PDF generation
  - ASCII copy-to-clipboard functionality of protocol
