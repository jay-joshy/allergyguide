{% admonition(type="warning", icon="warning", title="PLAIN LANGUAGE") %}

**This tool is strictly for use by qualified medical physicians. It does not replace professional medical advice**. OIT involves strict safety parameters, up-dosing schedules, and reaction management plans that vary by patient and institution. OIT should always be done under direct medical supervision. **Attempting to use these calculations without physician supervision can lead to life-threatening anaphylaxis and other harms. Do not use this tool to self-treat.**

{% end %}

**By using this tool, you acknowledge that you are a qualified medical physician.**

This tool is provided for clinical calculation and documentation purposes only. **It does not constitute medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment, and must not be relied upon as a substitute for independent clinical judgment**. All calculations, dose progressions, and transition thresholds generated by this tool must be interpreted, validated, and approved by a qualified healthcare professional prior to clinical use.

## Data Privacy & Local Processing

To ensure compliance with data privacy standards, this tool is designed to function **entirely as a client-side application**.

- **Local Processing**: All calculations, including the "Undo/Redo" history stack, are processed and stored temporarily in your browser's memory. This data is cleared when you refresh the page.
- **No Server Transmission**: Data entered into input fields, custom notes, and your interaction history are never transmitted to our servers, analytics providers, or stored in external databases.
- **PDF Exports & QR Codes**: When generating a PDF, the file is created locally on your device. The PDF includes a QR code designed for technical debugging and verification. This QR code encodes the specific protocol parameters (e.g., food choices, target doses), the version of the tool used to make it, and a log of settings changes.
  - The QR code information explicitly excludes the "Custom Notes" field. **It contains NO Patient Health Information.**
  - You acknowledge that by saving or sharing the generated PDF, you are responsible for the security of any data contained within the visible text of the document.
