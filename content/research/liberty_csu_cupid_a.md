## The clinical question

In patients with CSU refractory to H1-antihistamines, does dupilumab (an anti-IL-4Rα monoclonal antibody) reduce urticaria activity?

{% admonition(type="tip", icon="question", title="Why should we care?") %}

There are limited 2nd line therapeutic options for CSU refractory to AH, and therefore an need for more effective therapies. Prior to this trial, there was only case report data on dupilumab's efficacy for CSU.

{% end %}

## PICO

{% two_columns_fancy() %}

**Population**:

- **Inclusion Criteria**:
  - Diagnosis of CSU > 6 months before screening, that is symptomatic despite H1-antihistamine therapy up to 4-fold
  - Omalizumab-naive
  - UAS7 ≥16 and ISS7 ≥8 seven days before randomization
  - Ages 6 - 80 years, inclusive

- **Relevant Exclusion Criteria**:
  - Chronic inducible urticaria
  - Other diseases associated with hives or angioedema (ie. SLE, mastocytosis, HAE); active atopic dermatitis or other skin conditions potentially interfering with assessment
  - Known immunodeficiency, malignancy, or other severe comorbidity (ie. short life expectancy, severe heart failure, severe CKD)
  - Exposure to another investigative drug; exposure to immunosuppressive / immunomodulating drugs within 4 weeks of screening visit (ie. systemic steroids)
  - Pregnancy

<!-- split -->

**Intervention**:

Dupilumab plus background H1-antihistamine therapy:

- Adults/adolescents ≥60kg: 600mg loading dose, then 300mg every 2 weeks
- Adolescents <60kg and Children ≥30kg: 400mg loading dose, then 200mg every 2 weeks
- Children ≥15 and <30kg: 600mg loading dose, then 300mg every 4 weeks

**Comparison**:

Placebo (matched injections) plus background H1-antihistamine therapy

**Outcome**:

- **Primary**: Change from baseline in ISS7 at week 24

- **Relevant Secondary outcomes at week 24**:
  - Change from baseline in UAS7, HSS7 and UCT at week 24
  - Proportion of patients with UAS7 ≤6 (at least well-controlled symptoms)
  - Proportion of patients with UAS7 of 0 (complete resolution)
  - Proportion of patients with ≥5-point reduction in ISS7 (minimally important difference)

## Study Design

<span class="hl-yellow">24-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase 3 trial</span> conducted across 9 countries. Included a 2- to 4-week screening period, 24-week treatment period, and 12-week post-treatment follow-up period.

For
each study, patients will be randomized 1:1 to dupilumab or placebo. The randomization
will be first stratified by age (adults versus adolescents versus children in Study A and
Study C, adults versus adolescents in Study B; up to approximately 5% of total sample
size for children and approximately 5% of total sample size for adolescents in Study A and
Study C; up to approximately 5% of total sample size for adolescents in Study B). In
adults, randomization will be stratified further by country

• Screening period (2 to 4 weeks)
• Randomized IMP treatment period (24 weeks)
• Post IMP treatment period (12 weeks)

### How were outcomes assessed?

Within each study, the primary analysis population for the efficacy endpoints will be the
randomized intent-to-treat population which includes all participants who have been
allocated to a randomized treatment regardless of whether the treatment kit was used or
not.

Of patients assigned to each group:

- Dupilumab:
  - 6 discontinued, leaving 63 completing treatment: of the 70 initialy, 63 followed up post treatment
- Placebo
  - 18 disconitnued, 50 completed study treatment
  - 55 completed post intervention followup

### Primary Outcome

It doesn't really make sense for this article/education sense to separate the primary and secondary outcomes - at least to me, some of the 2' outomces are just as important as the 1' (UAS7 vs ISS7) and it seems purely semantic...

How best to diplay the figures? Probably .png, or just tables until the time course data?

**ISS7 (Itch Severity) at Week 24**:

- **Dupilumab**: LS mean change -10.2±0.9 SE
- **Placebo**: LS mean change -6.0±0.9 SE
- **Treatment difference**: -4.2 points (95% CI, -6.6 to -1.8; **P=.0005**)

### Secondary Outcomes

**UAS7 (Urticaria Activity) at Week 24**:

- **Dupilumab**: LS mean change -20.5±1.8 SE
- **Placebo**: LS mean change -12.0±1.8 SE
- **Treatment difference**: -8.5 points (95% CI, -13.2 to -3.9; **P=.0003**)

HHS7
in HSS7, change was −10.3 (0.9) versus −5.9 (0.9), difference −4.4 points (95% CI, −6.8 to −2.0; P = .0003)

**Responder Rates at Week 24**:

- **UAS7 ≤6 (well-controlled)**: 45.7% vs 23.5%, OR 2.8 (95% CI, 1.3-6.2; **P=.0075**)
- **UAS7 =0 (complete resolution)**: 31.4% vs 13.2%, OR 2.9 (95% CI, 1.2-7.2; **P=.0199**)
- **ISS7 ≥5-point improvement**: 72.9% vs 42.6%, OR 3.4 (95% CI, 1.6-7.3; **P=.0014**)

? show these like the table in E3?

**Urticaria Control Test (UCT)**:

- **Dupilumab**: LS mean change 7.7±0.6
- **Placebo**: LS mean change 4.9±0.6
- **Treatment difference**: 2.8 points (95% CI, 1.3-4.4; nominal **P=.0004**)

**Rescue medication use**: 5.7% dupilumab vs 8.8% placebo
Rescue medications, including H1-AH and oral corticosteroids, were used by 4 (5.7%) patients treated with dupilumab and 6 (8.8%) patients treated with placebo in Study A

Dropdown for some other secondary outcomes? like IgE
Median percent change from baseline in total serum IgE concentration was −48.2% for the dupilumab group at week 24 versus −6.3% for the placebo group. Figure E3

#### Adverse Events

Pooled from both Study A and B
Study A and Study B (pooled dupilumab [n = 124] vs placebo [n = 122]).

TEAEs that occurred with frequency (≥5%) in any treatment group were nasopharyngitis (2 [1.6%] in dupilumab and 7 [5.7%] in placebo), CSU (10 [8.1%] in dupilumab and 9 [7.4%] in placebo), and injection-site erythema (3 [2.4%] in dupilumab and 7 [5.7%] in placebo)

Table e9 basically; none were very impressive. One completed suicide in the placebo group.

**Treatment-emergent adverse events**:

- **Dupilumab**: 57.3% (n=71)
- **Placebo**: 56.6% (n=69)

**Common adverse events (≥5%)**:

- Nasopharyngitis: 1.6% dupilumab vs 5.7% placebo
- CSU worsening: 8.1% dupilumab vs 7.4% placebo
- Injection-site erythema: 2.4% dupilumab vs 5.7% placebo

## Limitations

- **Pediatric underrepresentation**: Only 4.3% pediatric patients (n=6 total) limits generalizability to children and adolescents
- **Racial homogeneity**: Predominantly white (68.8%) and Asian (25.4%) patients
- **Exclusion of mixed urticaria**:

### Statistical & Methodological Considerations

- **Multiple testing**: Large number of secondary endpoints increases family-wise Type I error
- Need to find out more about data imputation and how much was done...
- ? predictors of Dupilumab response? subgroup analysis?

## Comparison to other biologics in CSU:

## Risk of Bias 2 for primary outcome

**Primary outcome**: Change from baseline in Itch Severity Score over 7 days (ISS7) at week 24
Also basically applies to the rest of the survey data

### Domain 1: Bias arising from the randomization process

**1.1 Was the allocation sequence random?**
Yes

**1.2 Was the allocation sequence concealed until participants were enrolled and assigned to interventions?**
_Yes_ - Centralized randomization with treatment kit numbers not accessible to study personnel indicates adequate concealment.

**1.3 Did baseline differences between intervention groups suggest a problem with the randomization process?**
no

### Domain 2: Bias due to deviations from the intended interventions (effect of assignment to intervention)

**2.1 Were participants aware of their assigned intervention during the trial?**
_No_ - Double-blind design with matched placebo injections, participants unlikely to know their assignment.

**2.2 Were carers and people delivering the interventions aware of participants' assigned intervention during the trial?**
_No_ - Double-blind design with matched placebo injections, study personnel unlikely to know assignment.

**2.6 Was an appropriate analysis used to estimate the effect of assignment to intervention?**
Yes - intention-to-treat analysis with appropriate statistical methods (ANCOVA with hybrid approach using WOCF and multiple imputation)

### Domain 3: Bias due to missing outcome data

**3.1 Were data for this outcome available for all, or nearly all, participants randomized?**
need to r/a

**3.2 If N/PN/NI to 3.1: Is there evidence that the result was not biased by missing outcome data?**

### Domain 4: Bias in measurement of the outcome

**4.1 Was the method of measuring the outcome inappropriate?**
No

**4.2 Could measurement or ascertainment of the outcome have differed between intervention groups?**
_No_ - Same measurement methods and time points used for both groups

**4.3 Were outcome assessors aware of the intervention received by study participants?**
_No_ - Double-blind design

### Domain 5: Bias in selection of the reported result

**5.1 Were the data that produced this result analysed in accordance with a pre-specified analysis plan that was finalized before unblinded outcome data were available for analysis?**
Yes - Primary endpoint clearly pre-specified, hierarchical testing procedure documented.

**5.2 Is the numerical result being assessed likely to have been selected, on the basis of the results, from multiple eligible outcome measurements?**
Yes... there are multiple

**5.3 Is the numerical result being assessed likely to have been selected, on the basis of the results, from multiple eligible analyses of the data?**
_No_ - Primary outcome analysis appears to follow pre-specified statistical plan

### Overall Risk of Bias Assessment

**Key methodological strengths**:

- Centralized randomization with concealment
- Double-blind, placebo-controlled design
- Low and balanced attrition
- Pre-specified statistical analysis plan
- Validated outcome measures
- ITT
