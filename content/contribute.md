## Contribution process

Prerequisites: 1) there are staff who we have available to proofread drafts for topic sections 2) there is an editor who can take charge over the 'section' 3) We have a google drive "Resident Contributor Dashboard" (i.e. showing available topics and whoâ€™s working on what) to organize our efforts

1. Resident or fellow picks a topic they wish to do, and connect with editor for that 'section' (to be defined later)
2. Timeline is set for 1st rough draft (~ 2 weeks?)

- These drafts can be done through Google Docs drive somewhere for ease of use. While technically it can be done through markdown and version controlled through git, this lowers to barrier to entry.

3. Editor and contributor back and forth initial edits
4. Edited draft is sent to staff, necessary edits are made
5. Editor / Josh / someone with some coding knowledge will add content into website (there are some formatting nuances)

## Stylistic Principles

{% important(header = "General writing guidelines") %}

- Be concise and clear -- the intended use is for residents
- Use clear, structured formatting (headings, bullet points, tables) for readability
- Avoid passive voice where possible
- Abbreviations are fine but must be defined

{% end %}

{% warning(header = "General formatting guidelines") %}

- Bullet points: Prefer over long paragraphs; no periods at the end of items
- Emphasize key points: Use bold, color, and highlights
- Tables/Figures: Only if they enhance understanding (e.g., decision algorithms)

{% end %}
