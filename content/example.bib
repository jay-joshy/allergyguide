	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Food allergies, particularly peanut, represent the predominant cause of anaphylaxis. Whereas early allergen introduction has emerged as a potential preventive strategy, the precise impact of recent guidelines on peanut-induced anaphylaxis rates in Canada remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the 2017 Addendum Guidelines for the Prevention of Peanut Allergy on peanut-induced anaphylaxis rates in Canada.
METHODS: Using a comprehensive longitudinal registry capturing pediatric anaphylaxis presentations to the Montreal's Children's Hospital, we compared children with and without known peanut allergy who presented with peanut-induced anaphylaxis between 2011 and 2019 inclusive, excluding data beyond 2019 owing to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We calculated rates of peanut-induced anaphylaxis presentations per 100,000 age-adjusted all-cause emergency department visits using 4-month intervals. Interrupted time series analysis was used to compare anaphylaxis rate trends before and after 2017 for children ages 0 to 2 and 3 to 17 years.
RESULTS: We examined 2,011 cases of pediatric anaphylaxis, including 429 (21\%) triggered by peanuts. Compared with pre-guideline estimates, the yearly rate of change of peanut anaphylaxis rates decreased by 7.96 (95\% confidence interval -14.57 to -1.36; P = .018) after 2017 among patients with new-onset anaphylaxis in children 2 years of age or younger (n = 109). No significant changes were identified for older patients ages 3 to 17, or in patients with known peanut allergy.
CONCLUSIONS: Early introduction guidelines in Canada are associated with a reduced risk of new-onset peanut-induced anaphylaxis in young children within a single center in Montreal. Further research is required to assess the impact on a wider population and other food allergens.},
