Nasonex:

The very first time the spray is used; prime the pump by pressing downward on the shoulders of the white applicator, using your forefinger and middle finger while supporting the base of the bottle with your thumb. Do not pierce the nasal applicator. Press down and release the pump 10 times or until a fine spray appears. The pump is now ready to use. The pump may be stored unused for up to 2 weeks without repriming. If unused for more than 2 weeks, prime the pump again two (2) times, until a fine spray appears

Patients should be instructed on the correct method of use, which is to blow the nose, then insert the nozzle carefully into the nostril, compress the opposite nostril and actuate the spray while inspiring through the nose, with the mouth closed.
