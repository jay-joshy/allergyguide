## What are the sinuses?

We all have pockets of air behind our face, called the sinuses, that are connected with our nostrils. Each pocket is normally lined with a small amount of tissue that produces mucous to keep the area moist and healthy.

{% end %}

## What is chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), and how is it diagnosed?

When this lining becomes chronically (>3 months) irritated and inflamed, it becomes swollen and produces too much mucous. This can lead to blockages and poor clearance of mucous, reduced airflow, and poor drainage: **this is known as chronic rhinosinusitis**. To have CRS therefore, <span class="hl-yellow">you need **both** key symptoms and imaging evidence of sinus inflammation</span>:

{% two_columns() %}

{% admonition(type="info", icon="info", title="Key symptoms - at least 2 for at least 3 months") %}

- nasal congestion/fullness,
- facial pain, pressure, or fullness
- liquid dripping from the nostrils or the back of the throat
- decreased sense of smell

{% end %}

<!-- split -->

{% admonition(type="info", icon="info", title="Imaging confirming sinus inflammation") %}

This is done through either:

1. A _computed tomography_ (CT) scan of the sinuses, OR
2. _Nasal endoscopy_: an office procedure where a thin camera is used to directly see the sinuses

{% end %}

{% end %}

Sometimes, these symptoms are not quickly brought to medical attention due to being relatively mild and long-standing. You may also experience ear fullness, headache, fatigue, altered taste, and or cough, _those these are not always present and are non-specific_.

{% admonition(type="warning", icon="warning", title="Atypical symptoms you should watch watch out for?") %}
If you have any of the following, you should let your doctor know: these may suggest there is something else going on aside from CRS.

- new numbness or tingling
- nasal dripping that only occurs from one side
- recurrent nosebleeds
- double vision
- unexplained weight loss, recurrent fevers, night sweats

{% end %}

## There are 3 main types of CRS: with and without nasal polyps

{% two_columns() %}

**CRS without nasal polyps:**

This is the most common type. It may be linked to allergies, infections, irritants, or other factors.

**CRS with nasal polyps:**

Sometimes, CRS is caused by soft, non-cancerous growths called polyps that grow in the sinuses. If large enough, they can cause blockage of the nasal passages and sinuses. Often, there is also associated asthma; there may also be sensitivity to medications known as NSAIDs (for example, aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen). Polyps are usually found using nasal endoscopy or CT scan. It is unclear what exactly can cause these polyps to form.

<!-- split -->

**CRS with fungal allergy (Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis):**

It is normal for there to be a small amount of fungi spores in the air we breathe. Normally, we breathe them in and out without issue. However, when our body develops an allergy to these fungi it causes a distinct inflammatory response and very thick mucous. There is specific diagnostic criteria for this condition involving allergy testing, mucous analysis, and evidence on imaging.

{% end %}

## What are risk factors for developing CRS?

There are a variety of possible risk factors for CRS; often, more than one may be involved. These include:

{% two_columns() %}

**Allergies**:
If you are chronically exposed to particles in the air you are allergic to (for example, dust mites, cat/dog danger, molds), the resulting inflammation can drive and worsen CRS.

**Irritants in the air**:
Chronic exposure to irritants such as smoke and other irritants can increase your risk of CRS.

**Repeated viral infections**:
There is evidence that repeated viral infections (for example, the common cold) can lead to CRS, even though the virus itself goes away.

<!-- split -->

**Immune system problems**:
Though rare, if someone has certain problems with their immune system they are at higher risk of recurrent sinus infection and eventually CRS.

**Pre-existing structural problems**:
Variations in the structure of your nasal passages and sinuses may make you more vulnerable to developing CRS. However, _by themselves, these are very uncommon causes of CRS_. For example, a deviated septum.

{% end %}

## What further investigations can be done once CRS is diagnosed?

There is no standard panel of testing for CRS. However, depending on your symptoms and triggers, the following tests may be considered:

- Skin prick testing for common allergens such as dust and moulds
- Testing for certain immune deficiencies if specific criteria are met
- Testing for other conditions related to CRS, including asthma and NSAID sensitivity

## What are the available treatments?

CRS is often a **long-term condition**. While it might not be fully “curable,” **most people can manage symptoms well** with the right treatments. Your doctor will suggest likely a combination of the following to start:

### First-line / Cornerstone treatments

{% json_to_table()%}
[
{
"Treatment": "Lifestyle",
"Details": "
Avoid cigarettes and smoke<br>Avoidance of known triggers, irritants, and/or allergens
",
"Examples": "
Getting dust-mite covers;<br>keeping the cat out of the bedroom
"
},
{
"Treatment": "Nasal saline rinses",
"Details": "Washes out extra mucus and irritants/allergens. Cleaning the nose before other medications (for example, a steroid nasal spray) can help get them more effectively to the sinuses.",
"Examples": "This should be done with <b>sterile</b> saline. These are usually non-prescription, and may be in the form of squeeze bottles or pots. We recommend these more than the saline sprays if possible."
},
{
"Treatment": "Corticosteroid nasal sprays or rinses",
"Details": "Corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatories, but take time to work. With <i>consistent daily use over weeks</i>, they reduce swelling and inflammation. Most commonly, a nasal spray is used. Sometimes, a sinus rinse with steroids is used instead to better reach the sinuses.<br><br>Because these are only applied to the surface of your tissues and are not swallowed, extremely little steroid makes in into your blood. This is <b>not</b> the same steroid that bodybuilders would use!",
"Examples": "Omnaris, Nasonex"
},
{ "Treatment": "Antibiotics", "Details": "Used if there is an acute flare with suspected infection.",
"Examples": "Amoxicillin-clavulanate for 10 days. Moxifloxacin is an alternative for those with true penicillin allergies."}
]
{% end %}

{% admonition(type="danger", icon="danger", title="CONSISTENCY IS KEY") %}

The above treatments **do not work right away**, and need time with regular use before you expect significant improvement in symptoms.

{% end %}

### Further specialized therapies for CRS with nasal polyps

{% json_to_table()%}
[
{ "Treatment": "
Biologic therapies
",
"Details": "
Biologics are medications that target specific steps in the inflammatory process in CRS. When used in conjunction with first-line therapy they can offer significant relief, and often can help with other related conditions, like asthma.
",
"Examples": "
Dupilumab (brand-name Dupixent), omalizumab (brand-name Xolair), mepolizumab (brand-name Nucala)
"
},
{ "Treatment": "
Oral corticosteroids
",
"Details": "
Short courses of oral steroids can be used for rapid temporary symptomatic relief (~ a few weeks); they will shrink polyps and improve smell. However, oral steroids are absorbed all across the body and chronic use is associated with significant side effects, and should be used sparingly.
",
"Examples": "
Prednisone, 30mg per day for 7 days
"
},
{ "Treatment": "
Leukotriene blockers
",
"Details": "
These medications are most effective if there is also asthma. They also reduce inflammation through a different mechanism than steroids.
",
"Examples": "
Montelukast (brand-name Singulair)
"}
]
{% end %}

### The role of surgery

For CRS with or without polyps, endoscopic (with a small camera) minimally invasive surgery is considered **_when medical therapy has failed_**. Inflamed areas and blockages are removed and reduces the burden of inflammation in the sinuses, while also allowing improved penetration of first-line medications such as nasal steroids to reach the sinuses.

By itself, surgery does not cure CRS; unless other underlying risk factors are also being addressed, recurrence and worsening of CRS may occur. Revisions or repeat surgery may be required after a few years. The details of the surgery itself would be discussed with an Ear Nose and Throat (ENT) specialist.

## FAQs

**Is deviated septum a common cause of CRS?**
By itself, it is **not** a common cause of CRS, though can contribute to nasal blockage.

**Is CRS contagious?**
No, CRS itself is not contagious. However, infections that can worsen it (like colds) can be.

**Are oral decongestants like pseudoephedrine helpful?** No. In fact, chronic use can be quite harmful and lead to increased blood pressure.
