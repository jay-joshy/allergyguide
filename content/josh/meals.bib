	abstract = {Children 4 to 11 months of age who were at high risk for development of peanut allergy were assigned to consumption or avoidance of peanuts until 60 months of age. Peanut allergy was more than five times as likely to develop in children assigned to peanut avoidance. The prevalence of peanut allergy among children in Western countries has doubled in the past 10 years, reaching rates of 1.4 to 3.0\%,1–3 and peanut allergy is becoming apparent in Africa and Asia.4,5 This allergy is the leading cause of anaphylaxis and death due to food allergy and imposes substantial psychosocial and economic burdens on patients and their families.6 Peanut allergy develops early in life and is rarely outgrown.7–9 Clinical practice guidelines from the United Kingdom in 19989 and from the United States in 200010 recommended the exclusion of allergenic foods from the diets of infants at . . .},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Food allergies, particularly peanut, represent the predominant cause of anaphylaxis. Whereas early allergen introduction has emerged as a potential preventive strategy, the precise impact of recent guidelines on peanut-induced anaphylaxis rates in Canada remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the 2017 Addendum Guidelines for the Prevention of Peanut Allergy on peanut-induced anaphylaxis rates in Canada.
METHODS: Using a comprehensive longitudinal registry capturing pediatric anaphylaxis presentations to the Montreal's Children's Hospital, we compared children with and without known peanut allergy who presented with peanut-induced anaphylaxis between 2011 and 2019 inclusive, excluding data beyond 2019 owing to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We calculated rates of peanut-induced anaphylaxis presentations per 100,000 age-adjusted all-cause emergency department visits using 4-month intervals. Interrupted time series analysis was used to compare anaphylaxis rate trends before and after 2017 for children ages 0 to 2 and 3 to 17 years.
RESULTS: We examined 2,011 cases of pediatric anaphylaxis, including 429 (21\%) triggered by peanuts. Compared with pre-guideline estimates, the yearly rate of change of peanut anaphylaxis rates decreased by 7.96 (95\% confidence interval -14.57 to -1.36; P = .018) after 2017 among patients with new-onset anaphylaxis in children 2 years of age or younger (n = 109). No significant changes were identified for older patients ages 3 to 17, or in patients with known peanut allergy.
CONCLUSIONS: Early introduction guidelines in Canada are associated with a reduced risk of new-onset peanut-induced anaphylaxis in young children within a single center in Montreal. Further research is required to assess the impact on a wider population and other food allergens.},
