These guidelines describe controversies in the management of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) and include recommendations that take into account changes in the bacteriologic landscape. Recent guidelines in ABRS have been released by American and European groups as recently as 2007, but these are either limited in their coverage of the subject of CRS, do not follow an evidence-based strategy, or omit relevant stakeholders in guidelines development, and do not address the particulars of the Canadian healthcare environment.},

	abstract = {The European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps 2020 is the update of similar evidence based position papers published in 2005 and 2007 and 2012. The core objective of the EPOS2020 guideline is to provide revised, up-to-date and clear evidence-based recommendations and integrated care pathways in ARS and CRS. EPOS2020 provides an update on the literature published and studies undertaken in the eight years since the EPOS2012 position paper was published and addresses areas not extensively covered in EPOS2012 such as paediatric CRS and sinus surgery. EPOS2020 also involves new stakeholders, including pharmacists and patients, and addresses new target users who have become more involved in the management and treatment of rhinosinusitis since the publication of the last EPOS document, including pharmacists, nurses, specialised care givers and indeed patients themselves, who employ increasing self-management of their condition using over the counter treatments. The document provides suggestions for future research in this area and offers updated guidance for definitions and outcome measurements in research in different settings. EPOS2020 contains chapters on definitions and classification where we have defined a large number of terms and indicated preferred terms. A new classification of CRS into primary and secondary CRS and further division into localized and diffuse disease, based on anatomic distribution is proposed. There are extensive chapters on epidemiology and predisposing factors, inflammatory mechanisms, (differential) diagnosis of facial pain, allergic rhinitis, genetics, cystic fibrosis, aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease, immunodeficiencies, allergic fungal rhinosinusitis and the relationship between upper and lower airways. The chapters on paediatric acute and chronic rhinosinusitis are totally rewritten. All available evidence for the management of acute rhinosinusitis and chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps in adults and children is systematically reviewed and integrated care pathways based on the evidence are proposed. Despite considerable increases in the amount of quality publications in recent years, a large number of practical clinical questions remain. It was agreed that the best way to address these was to conduct a Delphi exercise . The results have been integrated into the respective sections. Last but not least, advice for patients and pharmacists and a new list of research needs are included.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This update of a 2007 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to manage adult rhinosinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer added to the update group, evidence from 42 new systematic reviews, enhanced information on patient education and counseling, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, expanded opportunities for watchful waiting (without antibiotic therapy) as initial therapy of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), and 3 new recommendations for managing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).
PURPOSE: The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing adult rhinosinusitis and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, promote appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management, and promote judicious use of systemic and topical therapy, which includes radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia.
ACTION STATEMENTS: The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should distinguish presumed ABRS from acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions and (2) should confirm a clinical diagnosis of CRS with objective documentation of sinonasal inflammation, which may be accomplished using anterior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy, or computed tomography. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should either offer watchful waiting (without antibiotics) or prescribe initial antibiotic therapy for adults with uncomplicated ABRS; (2) should prescribe amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as ﬁrst-line therapy for 5 to 10 days (if a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic); (3) should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications if the patient worsens or fails to improve with the initial management option by 7 days after diagnosis or worsens during the initial management; (4) should distinguish CRS and recurrent ARS from isolated episodes of ABRS and other causes of sinonasal symptoms; (5) should assess the patient with CRS or recurrent ARS for multiple chronic conditions that would modify management, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia; (6) should confirm the presence or absence of nasal polyps in a patient with CRS; and (7) should recommend saline nasal irrigation, topical intranasal corticosteroids, or both for symptom relief of CRS. The update group stated as options that clinicians may (1) recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation for symptomatic relief of viral rhinosinusitis; (2) recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation) for symptomatic relief of ABRS; and (3) obtain testing for allergy and immune function in evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent ARS. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should not obtain radiographic imaging for patients who meet diagnostic criteria for ARS, unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected, and (2) should not prescribe topical or systemic antifungal therapy for patients with CRS.},

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: BACKGROUND: The 5 years since the publication of the first International Consensus Statement on Allergy and Rhinology: Rhinosinusitis (ICAR-RS) has witnessed foundational progress in our understanding and treatment of rhinologic disease. These advances are reflected within the more than 40 new topics covered within the ICAR-RS-2021 as well as updates to the original 140 topics. This executive summary consolidates the evidence-based findings of the document.
METHODS: ICAR-RS presents over 180 topics in the forms of evidence-based reviews with recommendations (EBRRs), evidence-based reviews, and literature reviews. The highest grade structured recommendations of the EBRR sections are summarized in this executive summary.
RESULTS: ICAR-RS-2021 covers 22 topics regarding the medical management of RS, which are grade A/B and are presented in the executive summary. Additionally, 4 topics regarding the surgical management of RS are grade A/B and are presented in the executive summary. Finally, a comprehensive evidence-based management algorithm is provided.
CONCLUSION: This ICAR-RS-2021 executive summary provides a compilation of the evidence-based recommendations for medical and surgical treatment of the most common forms of RS.},

	abstract = {Background Evidence supporting topical steroids for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (CRSsNP) is unclear. Recent trials describe alternative topical steroid delivery modalities, including rinses and exhalation delivery system (EDS), necessitating a re-examination of the current literature. Methods Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PubMed, and Scopus databases were searched from inception to February 13, 2024 for placebo-controlled randomized control trials on topical steroids used to treat CRSsNP, including topical spray, nasal irrigation, sinonasal catheter, and EDS modalities. Primary outcome measures included total symptom scores (TSS) (Δ) and response rates (odds ratio). Results Ten trials (N = 751) were included for meta-analysis, with a mean age of 47.5 years (range: 18–80 years; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 43.9–51.2 years). Topical steroids delivered by any method significantly improved TSS in CRSsNP patients (Δ0.4; 95\% CI: 0.3–0.6; p {\textless} 0.0001). When stratified by allergy status, CRSsNP patients without allergy had significantly improved TSS when treated with EDS (Δ0.4; 95\% CI: 0.1–0.7; p = 0.01), but not with topical spray (Δ0.04; 95\% CI: −0.9 to 1.0; p = 0.94). Patients treated with EDS or sinonasal catheter responded significantly better compared to placebo (odds ratio [OR]: 3.4; 95\% CI: 1.9–6.0; p {\textless} 0.0001; OR: 12.4; 95\% CI: 1.8–83.8; p {\textless} 0.01), whereas patients treated with topical spray had no significant difference (OR: 1.8; 95\% CI: 0.9–4.0; p = 0.12). Conclusions Topical steroids are effective in treating CRSsNP, especially when delivered via EDS or sinonasal catheter. Future trials comparing steroid delivery mechanisms using validated outcome measures in CRSsNP populations are needed.},

	abstract = {Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a broadly defined process that has previously been used to describe many different sinonasal pathologic conditions from odontogenic sinusitis and allergic fungal sinusitis to the more contemporary definition of broad inflammatory airway conditions. Previous classification systems have dichotomized these conditions into CRS with nasal polyps and CRS without nasal polyps. However, clinicians are learning more about the inflammatory subtypes of CRS, which can lead to improved delivery and effectiveness of treatment.In clinical practice, treatment decisions are often based on observable findings, clinical history, presumed disease, and molecular pathophysiologic characteristics. A proposed classification system is simple and practical. It proposes that the functional anatomical compartments involved create the first level of separation into local and diffuse CRS, which are usually unilateral or bilateral in distribution. Diffuse does not imply “pansinusitis” but simply that the disease is not confined to a known functional anatomical unit. This classification takes into account whether local anatomical factors are associated with pathogenesis. Then the inflammatory endotype dominance is separated into a type 2 skewed inflammation, as this has both causal and treatment implications. The non–type 2 CRS encompasses everything else that is not yet known about inflammation and may change over time. The phenotypes or clinical examples are CRS entities that have been described and how they align with this system.Although research continues to further define the subtypes of CRS into phenotypes and endotypes, the proposed classification system of primary CRS by anatomical distribution and endotype dominance allows for a pathway forward.},

	abstract = {Saline irrigation for chronic rhinosinusitis
        , 
          Review question
        , We reviewed the evidence for the benefits and harms of nasal saline irrigation in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis., 
          Background
        , Chronic rhinosinusitis is a common condition that is defined as inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses (a group of air‐filled spaces behind the nose, eyes and cheeks). Patients with chronic rhinosinusitis experience at least two or more of the following symptoms for at least 12 weeks: blocked nose, discharge from their nose or runny nose, pain or pressure in their face and/or a reduced sense of smell (hyposmia). Some people will also have nasal polyps, which are grape‐like swellings of the normal nasal lining inside the nasal passage and sinuses., Nasal irrigation (also know as nasal douche, wash or lavage) is a procedure that rinses the nasal cavity with isotonic or hypertonic saline (salt water) solutions. The patient instils saline into one nostril and allows it to drain out of the other nostril, bathing the nasal cavity. Saline nasal irrigation can be performed with low positive pressure from a spray, pump or squirt bottle, with a nebuliser or with gravity‐based pressure using a vessel with a nasal spout, such as a 'neti pot'. This therapy is available over the counter and is used as a standalone or add‐on treatment by many patients with chronic rhinosinusitis., 
          Study characteristics
        , We included two randomised controlled trials with a total of 116 adult participants in this review. One compared large‐volume (150 ml) hypertonic saline irrigation with usual treatment over a six‐month period. The other compared 5 ml of nebulised saline twice a day with intranasal corticosteroids, treating participants for three months and evaluating them on completion of treatment and three months later. Both of these studies had important limitations in their methodology and we considered them to have a high risk of bias., 
          Key results and quality of the evidence
        , 
          Large‐volume, hypertonic nasal saline versus usual care
        , In the small trial of 76 participants our primary outcome of 'disease‐specific health‐related quality of life' was reported using a 0‐ to 100‐point scale. At the end of three months of treatment, patients in the saline group were better than those in the placebo group and at six months of treatment there was a greater effect. We assessed the evidence to be of low quality for the three months follow‐up and very low quality for the six months follow‐up., Patient‐reported disease severity was also evaluated but the trialists did not state the range of scores used, which made it impossible for us to determine the meaning of the data presented., No adverse effects data were collected in the control group but 23\% of participants in the saline group experienced side effects including nosebleeds (epistaxis)., General health‐related quality of life was also measured in this study. No difference was found after three months of treatment but at six months there was a small difference (although the result is uncertain). We assessed the evidence to be of low quality., 
          Low‐volume, nebulised saline versus intranasal corticosteroids
        , One small trial had 20 patients in each of the two arms being compared. Our primary outcome of disease‐specific health‐related quality of life was not reported. At the end of treatment (three months) there was an improvement in symptoms., 
          Conclusions
        , The two studies were very different in terms of included populations, interventions and comparisons and so it is therefore difficult to draw conclusions for practice. The evidence suggests that there was no benefit of a low‐volume (5 ml) nebulised saline spray over intranasal steroids, but there may be some benefit of daily, large‐volume (150 ml) saline irrigation with a hypertonic solution compared with placebo, although the quality of the evidence was low for three months and very low for six months of treatment.},

	abstract = {Short‐term oral corticosteroids compared with no treatment or other treatments for chronic rhinosinusitis
        , 
          Review question
        , We reviewed the evidence for the benefits and harms of a short course (typically up to 21 days) of corticosteroid given by mouth to people with chronic rhinosinusitis compared with giving a placebo or no treatment, or another type of treatment., 
          Background
        , Chronic rhinosinusitis is a common condition that is defined as inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses (a group of air‐filled spaces behind the nose, eyes and cheeks). Patients with chronic rhinosinusitis experience at least two or more of the following symptoms for at least 12 weeks: blocked nose, discharge from their nose or runny nose, pain or pressure in their face and/or a reduced sense of smell (hyposmia). Some people will also have nasal polyps, which are grape‐like swellings of the normal nasal lining inside the nasal passage and sinuses., Short courses of oral corticosteroids are a widely used treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis. They work by controlling the inflammatory response and when polyps are present they rapidly reduce the size of the polyps to improve symptoms. The adverse effects of corticosteroids can include insomnia, mood changes and gastrointestinal changes (such as stomach pain, heartburn, diarrhoea, constipation, nausea and vomiting). When given over the longer term, or through many repeated short courses, it is also possible to develop osteoporosis (fragile bones)., 
          Study characteristics
        , This review includes evidence up to 11 August 2015. We included eight randomised controlled trials with a total of 474 participants. All of the patients were adults who had chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. All of the studies followed patients until the end of treatment (two to three weeks) and three studies (210 participants) followed up people for three to six months after the initial treatment had ended. Five of the eight reports mentioned how the trial was funded. None of the funding sources were pharmaceutical companies., 
          Key results
        , At the end of a two‐ or three‐week treatment course, people who took oral steroids may have had a better quality of life, less severe symptoms and smaller nasal polyps than people who had placebo or did not receive any treatment. After three to six months, there was little or no difference in quality of life, symptom severity or nasal polyps between the people who had oral steroids and the people who had placebo or no intervention., The people who took oral steroids may have had more gastrointestinal disturbances and insomnia than the people who had placebo or no intervention. It is not clear if the people who took oral steroids had more mood disturbances than the people who had placebo or no intervention., 
          Quality of the evidence
        , We judged the quality of the evidence for oral steroids plus intranasal steroids for adults with nasal polyps to be low (further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the effect estimate and is likely to change the estimate), as the some of the results are only from one or two studies, which do not have a lot of participants. Most of the trials do not have a high risk of bias, but only people with nasal polyps were included in the review.},

          Review question
        , We reviewed the evidence for the benefits and harms of antifungal treatment in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis including those with allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS)., 
          Background
        , Chronic rhinosinusitis is a common condition characterised by inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses (a group of air‐filled spaces behind the nose, eyes and cheeks). Patients with chronic rhinosinusitis have at least two of the following symptoms for at least 12 weeks: either a blocked nose and/or discharge from their nose (runny nose) and one of either pain/pressure in their face or a reduced sense of smell (hyposmia). Some people also have nasal polyps, which are grape‐like swellings of the normal nasal lining inside the nasal passage and sinuses. Some people with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps are allergic to airborne fungus and this can cause a specific type of condition called allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS)., Fungal spores are commonly found in the nose as they are in the air we breathe. It is not clear if fungus plays a role in all cases of chronic rhinosinusitis but there is evidence that it may have a role in a subset of patients. Antifungal treatments work to kill fungal spores or to stop them growing. Antifungal treatments for chronic rhinosinusitis are used either topically (put into the nose) or taken systemically (by mouth)., 
          Study characteristics
        , We included eight studies (490 adult participants). Seven studies (437 participants) investigated topical antifungals (nasal sprays or irrigations) and one study (53 participants) investigated systemic antifungals (tablets). All studies compared antifungals to placebo or no treatment. Most studies were well conducted and there was a mix of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis both with, and without, nasal polyps., 
          Key results and quality of the evidence
        , At the end of at least four weeks treatment, none of the studies found that patients using antifungals (topical or systemic) had a better quality of life or less severe symptoms than patients who used placebo or had no treatment., Not many participants in the studies reported having adverse effects. Topical antifungals may lead to more nasal irritation compared with placebo. It is uncertain if patients taking topical antifungals have more headaches or nosebleeds than with placebo., For systemic antifungals, it is uncertain if patients using antifungals have more problems with their liver (hepatic toxicity) than with placebo. Systemic antifungals may lead to fewer patients with gastrointestinal disturbances compared to placebo., We found no studies that compared antifungal treatment with other treatments for chronic rhinosinusitis., We assessed the quality of the evidence as either low (further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the result) or very low (any estimate of the result is very uncertain), as some of the results are only from one or two studies, which do not have a lot of participants. Moreover, the different studies reported outcomes using different measurement scales making it difficult to draw conclusions., 
          Conclusions
        , Due to the very low quality of the evidence, it is uncertain whether or not the use of topical or systemic antifungals has an impact on patient outcomes in adults with chronic rhinosinusitis compared with placebo or no treatment. More trials are needed to assess well‐defined patient populations (such as the AFRS subgroup) and to evaluate other antifungals that have not been assessed in randomised controlled trials.},
