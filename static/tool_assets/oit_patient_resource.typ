= What is OIT?
OIT is a medical treatment for food allergies that helps patients gradually gain tolerance to the allergen. By slowly giving tiny amounts of the allergen and then slowly increasing the dose over time, the body gradually becomes used to the allergen. _In other words, the body becomes trained to tolerate doses of the allergen it previously could not_.

*OIT has two main phases:*

1. *Phase 1: Build-up.* Starting with a _*tiny*_ daily dose, every 2-4 weeks we slowly increase the dose until we reach a maintenance dose (usually a bit less than a serving size). This takes 6 - 12 months.
2. *Phase 2: Maintenance.* Once you reach the maintenance dose, it will be eaten daily for 12 months.

= What are the possible outcomes with OIT?

1. *Full Freedom (Tolerance):* you can eat a full serving of the food (like a whole glass of milk or a peanut butter sandwich) without reaction. Around 80% of preschoolers will get here.

2. *Safety (Bite-proof):* While you may still react if you eat a full serving, you can tolerate smaller amounts. This protects you from severe reactions if you accidentally eat the food. Around 18% of preschoolers will get here.

3. *Stopping:* Sometimes, OIT is stopped. This may be due to taste aversion, lack of time to commit for patient/family, side effects, or other reasons. This is rare: only around 2% of preschoolers have to stop.

#warning-box("Important Safety Note:")[
  #v(0em)
  *Remember:* Even after you finish the maintenance phase, if the food is not regularly consumed at least weekly to help the body 'remember' the food is not harmful, the allergy may return.

    - *Confirmed food allergy:* convincing story of reaction + either positive skin or blood testing.

    - *Young children:* Infants and preschoolers (under age 6) have immune systems that more easily 'unlearn' allergies.They are much less likely to have severe reactions during OIT than older children (imagine 1% versus 14%).

    - *Ability to be consistent:* The ideal patient eats their dose every day at around the same time. Their family must be willing, able, and ready to recognize and treat allergic reactions, including using self-injectable epinephrine properly.
  ],
  [
    - *Have uncontrolled asthma:* asthma *must* be well-managed before starting. Badly controlled asthma is a strong risk factor for severe allergic reactions during OIT.

    - *Severe active eczema:* Severe eczema can make it hard to tell when an allergic reaction is happening.

    - *Older patients:* while not a strict rule, once over 6 years old, patients are more likely to have anaphylaxis, and less likely to be consistent with doses

    - *Inability to obtain required equipment, language barriers, or inconsistent schedule*

  ],
  [
    - *Allergic reactions:* Mild reactions (itchy mouth, mild hives) *are common and expected, especially during the build-up phase*. Severe life-threatening reactions are rare, especially in preschoolers.

    - *Food pipe (esophagus) inflammation:*\ During OIT, around 3% develop inflammation of their esophagus. This condition is more common in those with food allergies in general, and we're not sure if OIT causes this, or is simply a bystander. If this occurs, we consider stopping OIT and involving our Gastroenterology specialists. In the majority of patients, this inflammation is transient and goes away when OIT is stopped.

  [*Examples:* BD eclipse 1mL oral syringes or Terumo 1mL oral tuberculin syringes (available on amazon.ca or local pharmacies)],
)

=== B) Digital Scale
#list(
  spacing: 0.75em,
  [*Precision:* Must measure *0.01 grams* (two decimal places).],
  [*Calibration:* Buy one that comes with a calibration weight (a little metal weight to test the scale).],
  [*Cost:* Usually \$20 - \$30 online.],
)

=== C) Medicines

#block()[
  #set list(spacing: 0.75em)
  - *Epinephrine Auto-injector:* Must be up to date and nearby at each dose.
  - *Non-drowsy antihistamine:* Optional but highly recommended. These can be bought over the counter.
    - Example: Reactine. For children under 2, give half of the smallest indicated dosage on the bottle. This usually is 2.5-5mg.
    - Avoid Benadryl - it is less effective and comes with more side effects. It also makes many children sleepy, which can make it more difficult to see the early stages of a developing allergic reaction.

  - Heavy exercise (sweating) or hot showers/baths 2 hours before and after the dose: regular play is fine.
  - Getting the dose on an empty stomach.
  - Sleep deprivation (e.g. overnight flight).
  - Symptoms of food-pipe inflammation (e.g. food getting stuck, chest pain, using more water to wash down food).

#enum(

  [*Give the dose with a meal or light snack*! To improve the taste, we suggest mixing it with a strongly flavoured food.],
  [*Space out doses*. If you are doing OIT to multiple foods, give each food sequentially at least 1 minute apart from each other.],

= What to expect from the first few weeks

- Especially near the beginning of OIT, mild reactions are common, and expected. Examples of mild reactions may include mild hives around the mouth, an itchy mouth, or mild stomachache. Refer to page X for full details about what to do if there is a reaction.
- Mild symptoms can be improved / potentially prevented by taking a non-drowsy antihistamine 1 hour before the dose. They do not prevent severe reactions.

= When do we move onto the next step?

Each step has a different _protein target_. In the example below, during Step 1 the patient will eat 1.0 mg of allergen protein daily; during Step 2, they will increase that to 2.5 mg of protein daily. But when do you move onto the next step?

- Usually, the daily dose is _escalated_ or _'updosed'_ (increased to the next step's dose) every 2-4 weeks *if there are no/minimal reactions*. _It may take more than 4 weeks for a step for some patients_.

= What do I do if there's a reaction after a dose?

Reactions can be either MILD or SEVERE. Mild reactions are expected especially in the beginning; however, they should be monitored in the rare case it progresses to a severe reaction. Record reactions in a diary.

= OIT in general
*Q: Is OIT a cure?*
Not exactly. It is a treatment. If you stop taking the daily dose, the allergy may likely come back.

*Can multiple foods be treated together during OIT?*
Yes, many children undergo OIT to multiple foods at the same time.

= About giving doses

*Q: Can the immunotherapy dose be taken on an empty stomach?*
NO. It is VERY IMPORTANT the dose NOT be taken with empty stomach. It MUST be taken with a snack or meal to slow digestion and absorption of the dose, which reduces the risk of reaction.

*Q: Why do I need to avoid exercise after the dose?*
May increase allergen absroption speed and also make it easier for the body to react. This is a very common cause of reactions in OIT.

*Q: Can I switch brands of food?*
A: Ask us first. Different brands of food can have slightly different amounts of protein or degrees of processing.

*Q: What if the patient spits out all or most of their dose?*

*Q: What if the patient is going to have an unrelated surgery?*

*Q: Should the patient avoid NSAIDs (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) during OIT?*

*Q: Does the patient need an antihistamine EVERY time before their dose of OIT?*

= About potential side effects

*Q: Eczema worse*?

- eczema more commonly worse from lots of non allergic triggers - dryness, irritants, stress, etc instead of food itself
- existing food tests like SPT or sIgE don't test for this
- benefits of OIT working tend to outweight any short term risk of flaring eczema

Worsening eczema is unlikely to be caused by the OIT
DOes not mean you have to stop

Spits up most of all of their dose
don't double dose, resume normal next day. if recurring contact team
