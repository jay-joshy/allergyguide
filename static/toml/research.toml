population = "4176 patients with <span class='hl'>mild persistent asthma (≥12 years)</span> were analyzed, including those with previously controlled and uncontrolled symptoms on minimal therapy."
intervention = "<span class='hl'>Twice-daily placebo + PRN budesonide–formoterol (200μg/6μg).</span>"
comparison = "<span class='hl'>Regular BID budesonide (200μg) + as-needed terbutaline (0.5mg).</span>"
outcomes = "At 52 weeks, the PRN budesonide–formoterol group had an <span class='hl'>annualized rate of severe exacerbations</span> of <span class='hl-green'>0.11 events/patient-year compared to 0.12 events/patient-year</span> in the budesonide group (RR 0.97; upper one-sided 95% CI, 1.16). <span class='hl'>ACQ-5 score</span> <span class='hl-green'>improved by 0.35 in the as-needed group versus 0.46 in the maintenance group</span> (Δ0.11 units; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.15; p<0.001). <span class='hl'>Median daily inhaled glucocorticoid exposure</span> in the as-needed group was 66μg vs 267μg in the maintenance group."
