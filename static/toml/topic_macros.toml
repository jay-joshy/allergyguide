*** Their symptoms are most consistent with oral allergy syndrome, which is a type of reaction that typically remains localized and does not progress to systemic illness/anaphylaxis. Symptoms are characterized by predominantly oral itch, scratchy throat, mild rash or swelling of the lips and occasionally abdominal upset after eating certain fruits, vegetables or tree nuts. It results from cross-reactivity between tree pollens and several fresh fruits, nuts, and vegetables, and usually disappears with cooked foods. The patients skin test was positive for ***, which cross reacts with ***. Therefore, her/his reaction to cherries may be attributable to oral allergy syndrome. We recommend

*** IgE suspected but unclear testing
> While history is consistent with IgE-mediated allergy, there is not current evidence of IgE sensitization on SPT - however, these tests are not 100% sensitive
> Offered serum IgE testing and/or a graded oral challenge at a later date
> We have asked them to start/continue a food-symptom diary

*** Non-immune reaction
> The clinical history is inconsistent with IgE-mediated food allergy, and skin testing was negative.
> Recommended a slow introduction at home. Once they have tolerated the food consistently, they no longer need to carry their epinephrine autoinjector
> However, given ongoing avoidance and concern around re-introduction we have arranged an oral challenge to liberate the patient from this label. They will continue to carry an epinephrine autoinjector until the challenge is completed

# Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome (FPIES) to: 
Based on clinical history, a diagnosis of FPIES is very likely. FPIES is a non-IgE mediated food allergy manifesting only by delayed gastrointestinal symptoms. Typically, it is rare to have FPIES to multiple foods (25% of children react to 2 foods and less than 10% react to ≥ 3 foods). There is no diagnostic test for FPIES beyond oral challenge, and diagnosis is usually based on clinical history. FPIES does not respond to epinephrine and there is no indication to carry an epinephrine auto-injector. The natural history of child-onset FPIES is excellent and most children will outgrow it within ~ 12 to 24 months.  

Plan:
> Two main options exist: 1) strict avoidance of ***, with consideration of oral challenge in ~1-2 years. However, with strict avoidance there is risk of development of an IgE mediated allergy. 2) A novel approach is the FPIES ladder to slowly reintroduce the food at home, starting with 1/64 teaspoon of the trigger food (using mini measuring teaspoons)
- Family has elected to pursue: 
- We provided guidance on how to use the ladder and sent a copy to the family. In case of mild symptoms, previous tolerated dose should be resumed for another 4 weeks. They should otherwise strictly avoid the culprit food
> In case of accidental exposure or intractable nausea/emesis, Ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg can alleviate symptoms. Occasionally, moderate to severe dehydration may occur and requires IV rehydration, which may present as pallor, lethargy, or syncope - in this case, immediate medical attention should be sought
> An explanatory letter to present to the emergency department physician in case of accidental exposure was sent to the family

# No amoxicillin allergy
Clinical history is not suggestive of an penicillin allergy as:

Additionally, the character of the rash is not in keeping with the urticaria expected in IgE-mediated allergy; the history was not concerning for serum sickness or severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions, such as Stevens Johnson Syndrome or Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis. Up to 95% of patients presenting with a rash following administration of an antibiotic do not in fact have a drug allergy, and rather the symptoms are most likely related to the infection itself rather than amoxicillin.

The oral drug challenge in clinic today was well-tolerated. This type of testing does not exclude delayed hypersensitivities: we asked that the family monitor for rashes over the next several days, take photos and contact our office if one appears. 

Future courses of penicillin may be given with no increased risk of allergic reaction compared to the general population for her age.

Their clinical picture is suggestive of CRS, an inflammatory syndrome defined by objective structural evidence of sinus inflammation and ≥2 cardinal symptoms (nasal congestion, facial pain/pressure, anterior/posterior nasal drainage, absent/reduced smell) ≥12 weeks. While chronic, regular pharmacotherapy can usually control symptoms well.

Recommendations:
* CT sinuses (non-contrast) vs ENT referral
* SPT for common aeroallergens
* Ad-hoc testing: ie. B-cell immunodeficiency workup in setting of suspicious symptoms / acute recurrent sinusitis
> High volume nasal saline rinses, avoidance of triggers

# Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) / Chronic inducible urticaria (CIU).
This is a generally benign, histamine-mediated idiopathic primary skin disorder. CSU is typically a self-resolving condition over 1-5 years; CIU is generally more long lived. In the vast majority of cases it is not a sign of more insidious underlying disease, though in some cases we arrange for baseline bloodwork to assess for rarer underlying causes.

  - Food avoidance with elimination diets is contreversial
> For symptomatic management we recommend 2nd generation antihistamines, with titration to 4x the regular dose as required. We have provided:
  - Rupatadine 10mg PO OD, which can be titrated to 40mg OD if required
  - Bilastine 20mg PO OD, which can be titrated to 80mg OD if required
  - The goal is complete control; thereafter, the dose may be slowly tapered to the minimal effective dose
> If refractory to maximal regular antihistamine, we will investigate further for alternative etiologies and consider biologic anti IgE treatment (omalizumab)

*** if COLD induced:
there is a risk of more severe reactions including anaphylaxis. As such, we have advised to keep her Epi Pen and to avoid significant cold exposures (cold plunges in water).

*** dermatographism:
This is a form of chronic inducible urticaria triggered by pressure on the skin. This is a self-limiting condition but can take months to years to subside; unfortunately, the only curative therapy is time. Intermittent flares are
not atypical. It can sometimes also be worsened during periods of stress, infection or other immune system triggers.

# Atopic dermatitis / Eczema. Current control: 
Atopic dermatitis is a common chronic primary skin condition thought to be a result of a complex interplay of genetics, environmental irritants/allergens, and microbiota. For many patients, the eczema will improve as they get older. Skin testing for foods without a history to suggest an IgE-mediated allergic reaction is not indicated as many false positives occur. Of note: empiric elimination diets in the general atopic dermatitis population have been unsuccessful based on available evidence and any perceived improvement may be due to the waxing and waning nature of the condition. However, avoiding allergenic foods can potentially lead to the development of food allergy. From a primary prevention standpoint, maintaining allergenic foods in the diet is protective against food allergy. 

Recommendations:
> Regular moisturization (at least BID) is a crucial part of management; there is strong evidence it reduces disease severity and need for prescription creams. We reviewed options such as (but not limited to) Vaseline, CeraVe, or Cetaphil creams
> For disease flares we suggest:
  - Betaderm 0.1% ointment BID to body and Desonide 0.05% cream BID (or Protopic 0.1% ointment BID, or Hydrocortisone 2.5% cream BID) to face, until clear of ezcema
  - If eczema returns quickly, a maintenance schedule of topicals 2-3x/weekly to eczema-prone areas will be considered, with taper back to OTC moisturization with sustained control
> If symptoms are refractory, we can consider systemic therapies such as Dupilimab and further investigate for mimickers such as allergic contact dermatitis, cutaneous T cell lymphoma, scabies, or immunodeficiency

> Dietary modifications:
  - Avoidance of food triggers for ~6 weeks; ~30-50% of patients improve with a milk elimination diet, which is the commonest trigger for EoE
  - If dairy avoidance alone is unsuccessful, we will discuss additional empiric 6 week avoidance periods of other foods (ie. fish, shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, soy, legumes), followed by reintroduction, with observation of clinical symptoms
  - Another alternative approaches include the 6-food (wheat, milk, egg, nuts, soy, fish and shellfish) elimination diet or 4 food (wheat, milk, egg, nuts, soy) diet, but should be done working with a dietician; they are harder logistically to implement

# Venom allergy: 

- Skin testing prior to intradermal may be considered if hx of anaphylaxis
- Otherwise, intradermal testing doses are titrated up until positive result (gives baseline for venom therapy)
  *** A skin test may be negative in the days or weeks after a sting reaction, which may be attributed to a refractory period of anergy; for these patients, the skin test should be repeated after 4–6 weeks

***non systemic reactions
The symptoms often last a few days to a week. The risk of a systemic reaction with a subsequent sting is about 5-10% which is only slightly higher than the general population (2-5%). Because of the low risk immunotherapy is not necessary but may be offered if the patient gets stung often and has frequent reactions as it will decrease the severity of the large local reactions.

***confirmed venom allergy
Systemic reactions to stinging insects have a 30-60% risk of a subsequent potentially life threatening reaction with another sting.
-The allergen of concern was identified today as

- Workup: baseline serum tryptase if history of anaphylaxis or atypical reaction

# Chronic cough
Cough is a normal reflex with protective mechanisms. Most people will cough 18-20 times a day NORMALLY.
When people come with chronic cough the goal of symptomatic treatment is not to get RID of the cough but to improve it and their QoL.
The cause of a cough can be varied, but cough by itself can be a 'cause' of cough; you become hypersensitive and cough triggers another cough

cough begets cough.
because it's a feedback loop there is likely going to be improvement after these drugs are taken away too
less cough = less cough, feedback loop

8.Recurrent deep abscesses of skin / internal organs
9.Persistent thrush/ fungal skin infections
10.Infected with normally harmless TB- like bacteria.
** if you have positive history of infection, ask in detail (age of onset, circumstance, type
of bug, where they vaccinated for this bug, how long did it need to be cleared,
complications)

Warning Signs of PIDDs in Children

1. ≥4 new ear infections within 1 year
2. ≥2 serious sinus infections within 1 year
3. ≥2 months on antibiotics with little effect
4. ≥2 pneumonias within 1 year
5. Failure of an infant to gain weight or grow normally 6. Recurrent, deep skin or organ abscesses
6. Persistent thrush in mouth or fungal infection of skin 8. Need for IV antibiotics to clear infections
7. ≥2 deep-seated infections, including septicemia
8. A family history of PIDD

# Immunodeficiency:

=> We have ordered quantitative Igs (IgG, IgM, IgA) as well as a response assay to vaccination (tet and dip for protein, pneumococcal for polysacc). Can consider flow cytometry for B, T, NK cells, C3/C4, CBC, HIV testing, CH50 (completment), neutrophil burst assay
=> Immunoglobulin replacement is the mainstay of preventative therapy of recurrent infections.

- IVIG > 400 to 600 mg/kg every three to four weeks vs:
- SCIG (more stable IgG numbers, good for people who react to IVIG, poor IV access, self administered at home, improved QoL) Higher doses may be required in patients with bronchiectasis and in those with protein-losing enteropathy
  Calculation for weight appropriate dose of IG: https://ivig.transfusionontario.org/dose
  The half-life of IG is approximately 30 days, Steady-state levels are usually achieved after
  three to six months of therapy
  => followup and screening: Pulmonary function testing yearly, CT thorax q5y, serum b12/iron qyear
  => IVIG monitoring? CBC, lytes, renal, ALT, quant Ig trough levels?
  => avoid live vaccinations such as live shingles, live flu shot, etc

* General monitoring for IEI associated with immune dysregulation^:
  - q6-12 months CBC/diff, LFTs, Cr, quantitative Ig; consider EBV/CMV viral loads
  - Annual B12, LDH, SPEP, Beta-2 microglobulin, TSH
  - PFTS annually. Last PFT:
  - CT chest q3-5 years and PRN. Last CT: 
  - Ideally q6 month in-person assessments; annual if geography difficult, with local IM involvement

^Immune dysregulation: risk of malignancy, lymphoproliferation, autoimmunity/autoinflammation. Includes CVID and combined immune deficiency patients.

Prior to challenge, risk of anaphylaxis and milder localized allergic reactions discussed.
Patient does not have any concurrent illness, does not use betablockers/ACEi or NSAIDs, has not recently had alcohol, has not exercised strenuously <2h prior to this visit, and is not sleep deprived.

Procedure:
A total serving size of *** was used, about *** grams of protein.
It was done in *** steps, seperated by [15 | 20 | 30] minutes each.
The patient was monitored about one hour after the last step.

Subcutaneous Immunotherapy (SCIT) to: 
> Typically there is 6-9 months of weekly build-up injections, followed by monthly maintenance injections
> Symptomatic benefit is expected within 1-2 years, with a total course of 3-5 years ideally and lasting benefit thereafter for at least several years; premature discontinuation is associated with less lasting benefit. In the case of relapse post-completion, a repeat course of immunotherapy can be done
> Risks discussed: Localized reactions are common and can be treated with non-drowsy antihistamines; prophylactic use before injections is common. Anaphylaxis occurs in 0.1-4% of injections, while fatal anaphylaxis is estimated at 1 in 2.5 million injections 
> Contraindications: Development of moderate/severe/ uncontrolled asthma. Spirometry showing FEV1<70. Use of beta-blocker or significant cardiovascular comorbidity and lack of physiologic reserve. Dose escalation is contraindicated in pregnancy. If the patient becomes pregnant while on immunotherapy, our office should be contacted immediately to decide whether to continue or stop immunotherapy
> Safety considerations: Doses should be held during times of respiratory illness; once maintenance is reached, **NEW MAINTENANCE VIAL DOSES SHOULD BE INITIALLY REDUCED BY 50%**
> We have ordered a prescription; once the serum is available we will arrange a follow-up visit for the first injection

> Sublingual tablets are given daily at home, with a typical course for 3 years. Symptomatic relief is expected within 6-12 months, with lasting benefit after completion of the full course. 
> Risks discussed: oral pruritus, eosinophilic esophagitis. Anaphylaxis is exceedingly rare with SLIT
> The first dose of each allergen must be give in clinic due to elevated risk of anaphylaxis
