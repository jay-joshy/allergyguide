# Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) wNP sNP
CRS is an inflammatory syndrome of >8-12 weeks with structural evidence of sinus inflammation + 2 or more of purulent drainge, facial and/or dental pain, nasal obstruction, or hyposmia. 

Recommendations:
- SPT for common aeroallergens
- CT head non-constrast for ostiomeatal complex vs ENT referral
- B-cell immunodeficiency workup in setting of suspicious symptoms / acute recurrent sinusitis
- Non-Rx: Nasal saline rinses, avoidance of triggers 
- Rx: INCS, LTRA if ASA sensitive, dupilimab for CRSwNP, tx for AR if present
