> Immunotherapy
> Consider baseline Tryptase testing if severe reactions consistently

*** IgE suspected but unclear testing
> While history is consistent with IgE-mediated allergy, there is not current evidence of IgE sensitization on SPT - however, these tests are not 100% sensitive
> Offered serum IgE testing and/or a graded oral challenge at a later date
> We have asked them to start/continue a food-symptom diary

*** Non-immune reaction
> The clinical history is inconsistent with IgE-mediated food allergy, and skin testing was negative.
> Recommended a slow introduction at home. Once they have tolerated the food consistently, they no longer need to carry their epinephrine autoinjector
> However, given ongoing avoidance and concern around re-introduction we have arranged an oral challenge to liberate the patient from this label. They will continue to carry an epinephrine autoinjector until the challenge is completed

*** Their symptoms are most consistent with oral allergy syndrome, which is a type of reaction that typically remains localized and does not progress to systemic illness/anaphylaxis. Symptoms are characterized by predominantly oral itch, scratchy throat, mild rash or swelling of the lips and occasionally abdominal upset after eating certain fruits, vegetables or tree nuts. It results from cross-reactivity between tree pollens and several fresh fruits, nuts, and vegetables, and usually disappears with cooked foods. The patients skin test was positive for ***, which cross reacts with ***. Therefore, her/his reaction to cherries may be attributable to oral allergy syndrome. We recommend

Their clinical picture is suggestive of CRS, an inflammatory syndrome defined by objective structural evidence of sinus inflammation and ≥2 cardinal symptoms (nasal congestion, facial pain/pressure, anterior/posterior nasal drainage, absent/reduced smell) ≥12 weeks. While chronic, regular pharmacotherapy can usually control symptoms well.

Recommendations:
* CT sinuses (non-contrast) vs ENT referral
* SPT for common aeroallergens
* Ad-hoc testing: ie. B-cell immunodeficiency workup in setting of suspicious symptoms / acute recurrent sinusitis
> High volume nasal saline rinses, avoidance of triggers
> INCS + treatment of any underlying causes
> Consider short course prednisone for symptom management (most evidence for CRSwNP or AFRS)

# Chronic spontaneous / inducible urticaria.
This is a generally benign, mast-cell mediated idiopathic primary skin disorder. Chronic spontaneous urticaria is typically a self-resolving condition over 2-5 years; chronic inducible urticaria is generally more long lived. In the vast majority of cases it is not a sign of more insidious underlying disease.

> Bloodwork usually not required for diagnosis, but in certain cases we consider CBC, CRP, LFTs, TSH, Calcium, H. pylori serology
> Non-pharmacologically we recommended:
  - They do/do not have physical triggers that lead to worsening of symptoms. We advised avoidance of ***
  - Symptoms can be exacerbated by stress and skin abrasions. Recommended regular moisturization at least twice a day to prevent dry skin and stress reduction
  - Food avoidance with elimination diets is contreversial
> For symptomatic management we recommend 2nd generation antihistamines, with titration to 4x the regular dose as required. We have provided:
  - Rupatadine 10mg PO OD, which can be titrated to 40mg OD if required
  - Bilastine 20mg PO OD, which can be titrated to 80mg OD if required
  - The goal is complete control; thereafter, the dose may be slowly tapered to the minimal effective dose
> If refractory to maximal regular antihistamine, we will investigate further for alternative etiologies and consider biologic anti IgE treatment (omalizumab)

*** if COLD induced:
there is a risk of more severe reactions including anaphylaxis. As such, we have advised to keep her Epi Pen and to avoid significant cold exposures (cold plunges in water).

*** dermatographism:
This is a form of chronic inducible urticaria triggered by pressure on the skin. This is a self-limiting condition but can take months to years to subside; unfortunately, the only curative therapy is time. Intermittent flares are
not atypical. It can sometimes also be worsened during periods of stress, infection or other immune system triggers.

The underlying etiology is not fully understood but felt to be food-related in many cases. Unfortunately, we do not have a testing modality to identify culprit foods.
The goal of treatment is both histological and clinical improvement.

> We have referred to GI / They should continue follow-up with their current GI; we defer to our colleagues regarding timing of repeat endoscopy

  - Swallowed fluticasone propionate (Flonase) 500-1000 µg/day OR oral viscous budesonide (Jorveza) 1000-2000 µg/day
  - Advised not to eat, drink, or rinse their mouth for 30 min after
> Dietary modifications:
  - Avoidance of food triggers for ~6 weeks; ~30-50% of patients improve with a milk elimination diet, which is the commonest trigger for EoE
  - If dairy avoidance alone is unsuccessful, we will discuss additional empiric 6 week avoidance periods of other foods (ie. fish, shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, soy, legumes), followed by reintroduction, with observation of clinical symptoms
  - Another alternative approaches include the 6-food (wheat, milk, egg, nuts, soy, fish and shellfish) elimination diet or 4 food (wheat, milk, egg, nuts, soy) diet, but should be done working with a dietician; they are harder logistically to implement

# Venom allergy: 

- Skin testing prior to intradermal may be considered if hx of anaphylaxis
- Otherwise, intradermal testing doses are titrated up until positive result (gives baseline for venom therapy)
  *** A skin test may be negative in the days or weeks after a sting reaction, which may be attributed to a refractory period of anergy; for these patients, the skin test should be repeated after 4–6 weeks

***non systemic reactions
.The symptoms often last a few days to a week. The risk of a systemic reaction with a subsequent sting is about 5-10% which is only slightly higher than the general population (2-5%). Because of the low risk immunotherapy is not necessary but may be offered if the patient gets stung often and has frequent reactions as it will decrease the severity of the large local reactions.

***confirmed venom allergy
Systemic reactions to stinging insects have a 30-60% risk of a subsequent potentially life threatening reaction with another sting.
-The allergen of concern was identified today as

- Workup: baseline serum tryptase if history of anaphylaxis or atypical reaction

> We counseled on sting avoidance techniques such as not eating/drinking outside, wearing shoes when walking in the grass and having nests professionally removed from the property
> We have prescribed an epinephrine autoinjector and discussed its use

# Chronic cough
Cough is a normal reflex with protective mechanisms. Most people will cough 18-20 times a day NORMALLY.
When people come with chronic cough the goal of symptomatic treatment is not to get RID of the cough but to improve it and their QoL.
The cause of a cough can be varied, but cough by itself can be a 'cause' of cough; you become hypersensitive and cough triggers another cough

cough begets cough.
because it's a feedback loop there is likely going to be improvement after these drugs are taken away too
less cough = less cough, feedback loop

Asthma
UACS (clearing of throat is a suggestive sign)
GERD

Then if all else is neg: cough hypersensitivity syndrome

* CBC, IgE
* CXR CT chest
* PFTs, maybe MCT
* Sputum eos / FeNO
* bronch is rarely ever helpful
* Encourage a cough diary - count the coughs per day to track frequency with treatment

> 1st line treatments to trial sequentially to assess their effect for 1-2 months each:
  - ICS trial
  - INCS with sterile saline nasal rinses
  - PPI trial
  - May consider short trial of prednisone, though not ideal
> In the setting of chronic cough refractory to investigations and/or first line treatment, we will to refer to respirology and consider 2nd line advanced therapies as below
> Advanced 2nd line treatments or in setting of significant QoL impairment:
  - Gabapentoids (ie. Rx: Pregabalin 25-75mg PO BID titrate weekly to target dose of 150mg BID, or gabapentin start 100mg TID titrate to 300mg TID target dose x 12 weeks)

# Immunodeficiency:

=> We have ordered quantitative Igs (IgG, IgM, IgA) as well as a response assay to vaccination (tet and dip for protein, pneumococcal for polysacc). Can consider flow cytometry for B, T, NK cells, C3/C4, CBC, HIV testing, CH50 (completment), neutrophil burst assay
=> Immunoglobulin replacement is the mainstay of preventative therapy of recurrent infections.

- IVIG > 400 to 600 mg/kg every three to four weeks vs:
- SCIG (more stable IgG numbers, good for people who react to IVIG, poor IV access, self administered at home, improved QoL) Higher doses may be required in patients with bronchiectasis and in those with protein-losing enteropathy
  Calculation for weight appropriate dose of IG: https://ivig.transfusionontario.org/dose
  The half-life of IG is approximately 30 days, Steady-state levels are usually achieved after
  three to six months of therapy
  => followup and screening: Pulmonary function testing yearly, CT thorax q5y, serum b12/iron qyear
  => IVIG monitoring? CBC, lytes, renal, ALT, quant Ig trough levels?
  => avoid live vaccinations such as live shingles, live flu shot, etc

* General monitoring for IEI associated with immune dysregulation^:
  - q6-12 months CBC/diff, LFTs, Cr, quantitative Ig; consider EBV/CMV viral loads
  - Annual B12, LDH, SPEP, Beta-2 microglobulin, TSH
  - PFTS annually. Last PFT:
  - CT chest q3-5 years and PRN. Last CT: 
  - Ideally q6 month in-person assessments; annual if geography difficult, with local IM involvement
