Content:

- Make example articles for 1) a condition (ie. penicillin allergy) 2) macro 3) research landmark article
  - done: medication example
- Topics:
  - Pediatric medicine crash course
  - add non-ige mediated mast cell degranulation section (with specific sections with things like IV iron, NAC, alcohol, opioids, etc)
- sections for pdfs for not only patient handouts but how to use inhalers, etc.
- port original pen-fast questions over with extra options; need to see if .PDF js packages are possible.
- Billing tips (would have to be province specific -- VERY fellow focused and low priority)
- consider creation of video resources if time permits -- a much later goal

Organizational:

- fully flesh out contribution process
- set up example google drive
- Reach out to staff re: supporting the project / funding?
- other resident / fellow support / thoughts?
- team structure?
  - main editor: josh
  - main staff: ?
  - other editors: ? other fellows interested -- ~3-4? to coordinate the editing process and reaching out to staff
  - editors who also can code / contribute: 1-2?

Shortcodes:

- consolidate and make dark/light themes for your boxes, particularly the question box (which does not look good on mobile)

Other stylistic:

- fix / make custom banner.png for the site
- Decide on design of home page
- Add author pictures to about
