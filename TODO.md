Content:

- Make example articles for 1) a condition 2) macro 3) research landmark article
  - Chronic rhinosinusitis, landmark trials (ie. Omalizumab and CSU, SYGMA, peanut immunotherapy, Xolair/Dupi for CSU, LEAP)
  - done: medication example
- Topics to add:
  - Pediatric medicine crash course
  - add non-ige mediated mast cell degranulation section (with specific sections with things like IV iron, NAC, alcohol, opioids, etc)
- sections for pdfs for not only patient handouts but how to use inhalers, etc.
- Figure out how to make website more visible to web crawlers -- while it is indexed the homepage is not showing up on search?

Lower priority content:

- port original pen-fast questions over with extra options; need to see if .PDF js packages are possible.
- creation of video resources if time permits
- Billing tips (would have to be province specific -- VERY fellow focused)

Organizational:

- fully flesh out contribution process
- set up example google drive
- Reach out to staff re: supporting the project / funding?
- team structure?
  - main editor: josh
  - main staff: ?TBD
  - other editors: ? other fellows interested -- ~3-4? to coordinate the editing process and reaching out to staff
  - editors who also can code / contribute: 1-2 but if needed Josh can do all of this (less sustainable however)

Shortcodes:

- consolidate and make light/dark themes for original admonitions
- a better question and answer dropdown section

Other stylistic:

- fix / make custom banner.png for the site
- Decide on design of home page -- ? macros, spt generator, topics?
- Add author pictures to about
