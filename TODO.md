# Content:

- Make example articles for 1) a condition 2) macro 3) research landmark article
  - Chronic rhinosinusitis, landmark trials (ie. omalizumab and CSU, SYGMA, peanut immunotherapy, Xolair/Dupi for CSU, LEAP)
  - done: medication example
- Topics to add:
- guideline compilation section (not sure if there's a way to automate this unfortunately)
  - insert this after the topics column somehow
- sections for pdfs for not only patient handouts but how to use inhalers, etc.
- Tools:
  - something to help with research appraisal?
  - Allergic rhinitis seasonal calendar for allergens?

# Lower priority content:

- port original pen-fast questions over with extra options; need to see if .PDF js packages are possible.
- creation of video resources if time permits
- Billing tips (would have to be province specific -- VERY fellow focused)

# Site:

- Optimize .PNGS used (see https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng and https://abridge.pages.dev/overview-abridge/#optimize-png-ico-files

# Organizational:

- add pages for topics to drive
- Reach out to staff re: supporting the project / funding?
- team structure?
  - main editor: josh
  - main staff: ?TBD
  - other editors: ? other fellows interested -- ~3-4? to coordinate the editing process and reaching out to staff
    - Medications, Research, Topics (? editors mix and match categories or we assign from the start?)
  - editors who also can code / contribute: 1-2 but if needed Josh can do all of this (less sustainable however)

# Shortcodes:

- popout icon (ie so you can show research supporting things)
