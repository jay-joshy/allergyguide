Content:

- Make example articles for 1) a condition (ie. penicillin allergy) 2) macro 3) research
- Pediatric medicine crash course
- port original pen-fast questions over with extra options; need to see if .PDF js packages are possible.
- add non-ige mediated mast cell degranulation section (with specific sections with things like IV iron, NAC, alcohol, opioids, etc)
- sections for pdfs for not only patient handouts but how to use inhalers, etc.
- Billing tips (would have to be province specific -- VERY fellow focused and low priority)
- consider creation of video resources if time permits -- a much later goal

Organizational:

- fully flesh out contribution process
- set up example google drive
- opinion from staff -- UBC, Western, McMaster?
- other resident / fellow support / thoughts?

Shortcodes:

- consolidate and make dark/light themes for your boxes, particularly the question box (which does not look good on mobile)

Other stylistic:

- fix / make custom banner.png for the site
- Decide on design of home page
- Add author pictures to about
