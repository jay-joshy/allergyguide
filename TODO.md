# Not yet started

- Billing tips (would have to be province specific -- VERY fellow focused)

## Shortcodes

## Misc

- Optimize .PNGS used (see https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng and https://abridge.pages.dev/overview-abridge/#optimize-png-ico-files
- Reach out to staff re: supporting the project / funding -- once example pages completed and overall structure of site more solidified
- team structure?
  - main editors: josh, adhora, more...?
  - main staff: ?TBD
  - other editors: ? other fellows interested -- ~3-4? to coordinate the editing process and reaching out to staff
    - Medications, Research, Topics (? editors mix and match categories or we assign from the start?)
  - editors who also can code / contribute: 1-2 but if needed Josh can do all of this (less sustainable however)
