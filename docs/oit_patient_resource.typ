Note: hand out should be written at a grade 6 level. It should be clearly organized, numbered, have diagrams / images that look good in black and white for easy printing.

= Oral Immunotherapy (OIT): hand-out
== What is OIT?
OIT is a medical treatment for food allergies that helps patients gradually gain tolerance to the allergen. By slowly introducing tiny amounts of the allergen and then slowly increasing the dose over time, the immune system gradually becomes used to the allergen. _Eventually over ~2 years, the body becomes trained to tolerate doses of the allergen it previously could not_.

OIT has two phases: 1) build-up and 2) maintenance.

// Need diagram: ie using cetz
// Phase 1 and phase two, graph with y axis being dose
// Slow build up during phase 1 until maintenance dose, every 2-4 weeks
// maintenance dose for 1 year or more -> exit challenge

Reference: https://www.csaci.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Key-concepts-teaching-tool.pdf

== Outcomes
1. Tolerance of serving sizes of food
2. While cannot tolerate a full serving size of food, can Tolerance of maintenance dosing and ability to tolerate a lot more allergen than before, protecting against accidental exposures

For both 1. and 2., if the food is not regularly consumed at least weekly to help the body 'remember' the food is not harmful, the allergy may return.

3. OIT has to be stopped (rare)

== Who is a good candidate for OIT? Who is not?
It is especially helpful for those with moderate to severe allergies. Reduce risk of severe reaction
The best are pre-schoolers < age of 6; infants especially
In general, the older you get
There is evidence to show that
Able to stay consistent with regular daily doses

== Benefits

At the best possible outcome, eating serving sizes of food
Severity of reaction down, decreased risk of severe allergic reactions
Open up diet
Peace of mind, reduction of anxiety for patient and family

== Risks

- Associated with EoE infrequent, % would be nice (not sure if cause or association, in some select cases we elect to continue)
- Severe reaction (mild reactions are EXPECTED and common)

= Getting ready for OIT: equipment and how to use
== Equipment list

1. 1 ml disposable syringes without the needles. They should have 0.1 ml increments marked on the side of the syringe.
- Example: BD eclipse 1mL oral syringes or Terumo 1mL oral tuberculin syringes (available on amazon.ca or local pharmacies).

2. Weight scale, with precision of 0.01 grams. Purchase a scale with two decimal places, with calibration weight. Scales are usually in the \$20-30 price range and can be easily found online (e.g. Amazon).
- Example:

3. Epinephrine autoinjector. Regularly check that it is up-to-date.

4. Optional but highly recommended. Non-drowsy antihistamine. These can be bought over the counter.
- Example: Reactine. For children under 2, give half of the smallest indicated dosage on the bottle. This usually is 2.5-5mg
- *Avoid Benadryl*.

== Using a weighing scale

- Specs required
  - 0.01g precision
  - calibration scale need walk through
- Measuring solid foods or thick liquids that don't fit in a syringe (ie. mustard)
  - Use cup that you tare
-

== Measuring with a syringe
- with bigger volumes should also have bigger measuring syringes ie 5mL, 10mL etc. with 1mL increments
- If used to draw up food, syringes may be re-used if they are cleaned properly in a hot water-soap bath with removal of the plunger and air dried. Dirty syringes can cause illness.
- If used only for water, it does not need to be discarded; just remove the plunger and air dry after use.

== Preparing dilutions / mixtures
- for some foods you need to dilute to get the right dose. Show example of table
- measure x powder with scale then add water mix well etc.
- For some foods, it is natural to see sediment build up at the bottom. This occurs due to some of the powders having a higher fiber content. There is no harm to consuming the sediment.
- In the first few months of OIT, prepare the powder mixture away from patient if possible, avoid accidental inhalation of powder

== Money saving tips
- freezing non-dairy milks with limited shelf life
- mix well first before pouring into ice cube trays
- talk thawing safety
- don't refuse thawed milk

= Giving doses: checklist, how to give, when to increase

== Giving doses
- Checklist before daily dose
  - Make sure nutritional label protein content matches
  - Avoid strenuous exertion (makes them sweat)
  - sick with fever
  - no empty stomach
  - monitorable for 2 hours
- keep the food consistent don't switch forms
- Avoid naps or bedtime within 2 hours of dose

== What to expect from the first few doses
- ensure good lip care to avoid quick absorption, consider petroleum jelly before and after each dose.
- Taking Reactine 1 hour before daily dose during build-up can minimize mild side effects.

== When to increase dose
- min time 2 weeks
- depending on phys / talk / reactions etc may spend longer
- but if on 2 weeks and no sx prob good to go up

= Troubleshooting

== What to do when my child has a reaction
== Sickness
== Missed doses
== Child dislikes taste
== Other
== When to contact us
- uncontrolled asthma
- severe reactions need for epi hospital etc
- missed doses
- severe active eczema
- new significant heartburn or egid /eoe sx though hard to tell in infants

= Q and A for common questions

== Reasons patients stop OIT
- Reactions logistics patient hates taste ok with avoidance
