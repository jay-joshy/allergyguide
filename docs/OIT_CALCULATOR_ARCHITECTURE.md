## Patterns

### Unidirectional Data Flow

1. **Event:** DOM interaction (ie input)
2. **Delegate:** `ui/events.ts` (or specific UI modules) catches the event that bubbles up
3. **Action:** a handler calls a 'pure' func from `core/protocol.ts` to calculate _new_ protocol data
4. **State Update:** new object is passed to `protocolState.setProtocol()`
5. **Notify:** `ProtocolState` notifies subscribers (Renderers)
6. **Render:** `ui/renderers.ts` updates DOM to match new state

### HTML DOM Patching

- **Structure Check:** check if the DOM structure (number of rows, existence of settings blocks) matches state
- **Patching:** renderer iterates through elements and updates only changed values (attributes, text content, input values) using `patch*` methods
- **Rebuild:** `innerHTML` full HTML replacement is triggered when the structure changes (ie, adding a step, switching food types)

### Event Delegation and Initialization

- Listeners are attached once to container elements (`.food-a-container`, `.output-container table`) via `initGlobalEvents`
- Specific feature listeners (Search, Export) are initialized in their respective modules (`initSearchEvents`, `initExportEvents`) called by `main.ts`
- Input events use **Debouncing** (150ms-300ms) to prevent excessive recalculations

## Known Issues / Design Decisions

- **Clear Button Behavior:** "Clear Food B" button is destructive and resets steps that were converted to Food B back to Food A steps (recalculating based on Food A settings); ? in future make it so that if steps are deleted and the food B is cleared, that the number of steps / targetMgs are preserved? TBD

## Roadmap to v1.0.0

### 1. Safety and Core Logic Validation

- The logic in `calculator.ts` and `protocol.ts` (dose calculations, dilution determination) must be **stabilized** and very thoroughly tested.
- `validator.ts` must be robust and comprehensive as possible. Current warnings should be reviewed and other possible warnings should be brainstormed and implemented if valid.
- Disclaimer/Liability language should be solidified.

### 2. Data Integrity and "Rough" Assets

- Clean `typed_foods_rough.json`. Likely remove foods with protein of 0. Have more accurate generated food types. Rename 'final' to `cnf_foods_v1.json`.
- Ensure bounds in `data_integrity.test.ts` are comprehensive (e.g., ensure no food has 0g protein unless intended, check for duplicates).

### 3. Development of export content / format

- Make sure PDF resource for static patient handout is comprehensive and peer-reviewed
- Make sure ASCII export works well in EMRs

### 4. Testing, QA

- **Unit Test Coverage:** Mainly want high coverage for `core/` files. Some edge cases:
  - Transitioning foods with vastly different protein concentrations.
  - Switching from Solid to Liquid mid-protocol.
  - Floating point precision (round-trip verification).
- **User Testing:** Stress testing by non-developers to try and generate nonsensical protocols or any bugs. Making sure the UI is intuitive and there are no further breaking features to implement.
- **Mobile Testing:** while this is intended for desktop, it should still work as expected on mobile.

### 5. Stability and Persistence

- **Undo/Redo Stability:** Verify `ProtocolState` history stack and doesn't grow infinitely or behave unpredictably during complex edits.
